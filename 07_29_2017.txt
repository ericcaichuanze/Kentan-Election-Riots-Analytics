At least one person was killed and about 20 inmates escaped in a prison break in Bukavu in the east of Democratic Republic of Congo on Friday, the city's mayor said.

It was at least the sixth such incident in Congo since May and underscores how lawlessness has spread since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down at the end of his mandate last December.

The inmates escaped after an unidentified person threw a grenade inside the prison, Mayor Philemon Yogolelo told Reuters. A visitor to the prison was killed and four others wounded when prison guards opened fire to try to stop the mass escape.

"The guards are right now counting the prisoners to know if the number of fugitives needs to be adjusted," Yogolelo said. The prison population is ordinarily around 1,000.

About 4,000 inmates escaped the capital Kinshasa's main high-security prison in May after an attack the government blamed on a separatist sect. Another 930 broke out of a prison in the northeastern city of Beni the following month.

Deteriorating security, including an insurrection in central Congo that has killed more than 3,000 people since last August, has led some of Kabila's allies to call on him to decree a state of emergency.

In North Kivu province, also in the east, a local self-defence militia overran the town of Mabuo earlier this week, killing a soldier, the administrator for the province's Lubero region, Joy Bokele, said on Friday.

A local monitoring group, the Centre of Study for the Promotion of Peace, Democracy and Human Rights, said the militiamen also took about 100 villagers hostage. Bokele said he could not yet confirm that information.

Kabila has ruled Congo, a vast tinderbox of rivalries over mineral rights and ethnicity, since 2001. His refusal to quit power has raised fears the country could relapse into the civil wars of the turn of the century that killed millions.

Nairobi governor aspirant Miguna Miguna's running mate has quit the position citing poor working relations.

Karen Wangenye is a 29 -year-old businesswoman who graduated with a degree in sociology from the Catholic University of Eastern Africa in 2010.

In an address to the media at a Nairobi hotel on Saturday, Wangenye noted Kenya needs a leader who can be a team player.

"If a team player is not compatible with his people then they are not fit to be in any office," she said.

Before choosing Wangenye as his running mate, Miguna dropped James Githungu, 24, whom he had already introduced to Kenyans.

The Nairobi governor candidate said his choice of Githungu was a decoy “to throw my opponents off the balance".


"You know there are many cartels and Miguna is a strategist,” he said.

More on this: Githungu, 24, was decoy to throw off opponents, says Miguna

Miguna will face Incumbent Evans Kidero, Mike Sonko and Peter Kenneth in the August 8 general election.

Wangenye once said she and Miguna stand for integrity and transparency, which will transform the city.

“I have never been in politics before, but I have known Miguna for a long time. He has been my mentor till we came to this agreement that I be his running mate,” she said.

Art exhibitions act as a platform an artist can utilise as the perfect opportunity to showcase diverse creative angles that represent the current state of mind. For years, Ng'endo Mukii's greatest pleasure has been to exhibit her work around the world, and more specifically, back here at home. Every time she has done it, she's left a lasting effect on her audience.

The award-winning artiste is a representation of true women's artistic talent. She is a compelling storyteller whose work details great quality. If you believe in good art, there's a lot of very good reasons to celebrate the intricacy she historically and currently exhibits.

A graduate of the Royal College of Art in London and Rhode Island School of Design, she has placed herself among the most determined, capable of interpreting her artistic capabilities through photography, film and animation.

Through these media, she's been able to exhibit the vibrant, ever-changing, contemporary Africa. Her films, which incorporate both real-life performances and illusions of motion, have greatly focused on self-appreciation.


In September 2012, she released the critically acclaimed, seven-minute animated film, Yellow Fever, which explored reasons why people use skin-bleaching chemicals to lighten their skin. The film, which was her thesis project, won various accolades around the world.

Recently at the Goethe Institute, Nairobi, alongside other renowned artists in Africa, she showcased her Virtual Reality film, "Nairobi Berries". The film, the first of its kind to be showcased in a public gallery, was a dreamscape showcasing the various feelings she has about the city of Nairobi.

Despite the damning statements that condemn women in art, Ngendo seems to be challenging that notion and turning herself into one of the most celebrated artistes in Africa.

Ngendo Mukii is making the necessary strides in her career as an artiste not only representing women but Kenya as a whole. She continues to exhibit her brilliance and certainly has a shot at history.Starlets

The Botswana national women’s football team have pulled out of their 2018 World Cup Under-20 qualifier return leg against host Kenya.

The second leg was set for August 5 at the Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos.

Kenya had recorded a resounding 7-1 win against Botswana away during the first leg a fortnight ago. With Botswana out, the stage has been set for the Kenyan girls under the stewardship of Caroline Ajowi to face neighbours Ethiopia away on September 29 in the next qualification phase. According to a communiqué from the Botswana Football Association signed by the chief executive officer Ookeditse Malesu, the team pulled out due to lack of funds.


“The team will not travel to Kenya for the return leg on August 5 in Nairobi. The Association has financial constraints hence we are unable to continue with the participation in the tournament,” the letter read in part.

“Having considered all the available options, and in accordance with the required notices of withdrawal, the FA has resolved that the national women’s Under-20 team will be withdrawn from the qualification.”

Reached for comment, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) communication officer Barry Otieno, said they have seen the email copied to them by the Botswana Football Association but they will have to wait for official communication from Confederation of Africa Football. “We have seen the email copied to us from BFA saying that Botswana will not honour the return leg due to financial constraints. But as it is now, we await the official communication from Caf,” said Otieno. The team is currently training at the Kenyatta Stadium, Machakos.Starlets

Supporters of JP Kirinyaga governor candidate Anne Waiguru on Thursday protested in Kerugoya town after her convoy was attacked at Kibingo shopping centre on Tuesday.

The protesters — mostly women — urged police to act swiftly and bring culprits to book. One protester, only identified as Sarah, said police should provide security to candidates during campaigns, especially women because they are more vulnerable than their male competitors. The protesters marched to Kerugoya police station and were addressed by Kirinyaga county police boss David Kirui. Kirui (pictured) said he had dispatched riot police. He added that investigations are ongoing. The police boss said culprits will be brought to book once investigations are completed. Kirui warned the youth against allowing themselves to be misused.


Waiguru’s campaign convoy was attacked by hooligans at Kibingo shopping centre in Kirinyaga Central. Some reports indicate that men in a Toyota Probox arrived at the rally and incited the youths. Waiguru’s chief campaigner Moses Waweru sustained head and chest injuries and is admitted at the Tenri Hospital in Embu county. The goons attempted to burn Waiguru’s Toyota Prado. Police fired in the air to rescue the candidate.

SportPesa Premier League resumes this weekend after a week-long break with eight matches set to be played at various venues around the country.

The local league action took a break last weekend to pave way for the GOtv round of 16 matches.

Ulinzi, who sit at the summit of the table, stand a big chance of consolidating their lead when they welcome league newbies Nzoia Sugar at Afraha Stadium tomorrow.

However, the weekend’s highlight will be the match between defending champions Tusker and Posta Rangers at Kinoru Stadium tomorrow. The brewers, who are seeking to topple Ulinzi, sit fourth on the log with 28 points, a point behind their tomorrow’s opponents. George Nsiimbe’s side have collected straight wins from the venue since its opening.

Tusker, who were frustrated by a 1-0 defeat to Western Stima in their last outing, will count on the striking triumvirate of Michael Khamati, Noah Wafula and Allan Wanga for goals, which have been scarce for them. Sammy Omollo on the other hand, will not be willing to give easy points to their fellow title contenders and a side he won the league with in 2011. His combative approach has seen his side record narrow wins and concede few goals—a record which has placed them second with 29 points. Today at Nyayo Stadium, the 2009 champions Sofapaka lock horns with Muhoroni Youth who made changes in their technical bench, bringing in experienced Gilbert Selebwa to take over the reins. Batoto Ba Mungu, who bowed out the GOtv Shield at the hands of Kariobangi Sharks, aim to bounce back with a win in a bid to close in on the leaders.


At the same venue, AFC Leopards and their new coach Robert Matano will be given a test of his good start when they host Western Stima. Ingwe have in the past struggled to beat Stima although it remains to be seen how they fare after Matano returned them to winning ways after dropping points in eight successive games.

The tactician rested a number of his regulars in their midweek GOtv Shield match against Bidco United on Wednesday to reserve them for this weekend’s match.

Matano will welcome Vincent Oburu and Victor Majid who were away in Spain for a national duty.

Bottom-placed Mathare United travel to Mumias Sports Complex to play Kakamega Homeboyz with Francis Kimanzi a very worried man after managing only two wins in the entire campaign. At Chemelil Sports Complex, Nicholas Muyoti will be out land his first win for Thika United when they take on hosts Chemelil Sugar. Tomorrow, on form Kariobangi Sharks host Zoo Kericho at Nyayo Stadium with William Muluya aspiring to bag the precious three points. The clash will pave way for 15 time champions Gor Mahia, who play Nakumatt FC.For those of us privileged to have finished college a few years back, we try to maintain the relationships and friendships we believe have been forged through the best and worst times. And as we look at our framed pictures of the good times, we realise the truth lies in the difficulties that come in maintaining those friendships. Now, imagine you and your friends are followed around by cameras to document your friendship some years after college. What would the story be?

Friends from College documents the lives of six friends who met at Harvard as they get to their 40s yet face a daily struggle of navigating adulthood. Ethan Turner is a prized writer who is struggling to write his next book. His agent and college friend Max tries to get Ethan into writing young adult fiction. Ethan and his wife Lisa move to New York, where Lisa takes up a job as a hedge fund lawyer. While Lisa and Ethan find an apartment, they move in with their other friend Marianne, who is a hippie yoga instructor. Ethan has also been having a 20-year affair with another college friend, Samantha. Samantha is an interior decorator who is married and lives in Manhattan. To round off, there is the 'old yet refuses to age' party boy Nick. Nick has no job and lives off his trust fund.


The show traverses the comically tragic lives of these six friends as they go about their somehow entangled lives. Is the show great? Not really. It’s simply passable. It’s nothing compared to Keegan Michael Key’s performance on the comedy show Key & Peele. Key is somewhat lost in his character as he tries to balance his naturally funny persona with the somewhat dramatic character. Some lines are definitely crack-up worthy, but the cringe lines and tediously long episodes overshadow the potential of the show. We expect more from a great comedy ensemble cast.

Star rating: 2 stars.Kenya beat Uganda 3-0 (25-12, 25-15, 25-12) in their opening match as the 2018 World Championship qualifier got underway yesterday at the Safaricom Indoor Arena, Kasarani.

The national women’s volleyball team coach Japeth Munala was impressed with the display of three debutants— Emmaculate Chemutai, Leonida Kasaya and Cellestine Nyongesa— as the Kenyans sealed the match in less than an hour. Kenya paraded Janet Wanja, Brackcidise Agala, Triza Atuka, Violet Makuto, Noel Murambi, libero Agripina Kundu and captain Mercy Moim as the home team overwhelmed Ugandans in all departments.

Host took an early 8-4 lead at the first technical time out with Moim and Makuto as the main tormentors as the set gathered momentum.

Uganda captain Margaret Namya individual efforts were noticed but were not good enough as they trailed Kenya 16-9at the second TTO.

Coach Munala then made two substitutions, resting experienced middle blocker Agala for African best blocker Edith Wisa and libero Kundu for fast-raising Cellestine Nyongesa as Kenya extended lead 23-11 before wrapping up the set 25-12.

In the second set that saw Wisa make way for Agala again, Kenya once again opted to fight from front as Makuto continued to haunt their opponents with her blade like spikes, catapulting the hosts to 8-4 at the first TTO. Agala and Murambi presence would then be felt with their water tight blocks as Kenya extended the lead 16-7 at second TTO .


It was again time for changes as Munala brought in Emmaculate Chemutai and Anne Lowem for Makuto and Atuka as Kenya continued to terrorise their opponents with a 23-13 lead. Efforts by Uganda’s duo of Peace Busingye and Christine Alupo to stall the set with their fantastic spikes failed as Kenyan won 25-15.

In third set, Wanja made way for sensational setter Jane Wacu as Kenya squeezed a 5-3 lead before extending it to 8-4.

Murambi then followed as Evelyne Makuto took her place while Moim was replaced by utility player leonida Kasaya as Kenya continued overwhelm Uganda.

Uganda’s poor services awarded Kenya points as they opened a seven-point lead (17-10) before Wacu, Wisa and Chemutai combined well up-front to earn three quick points to extend lead 21-12. From here it was all easy as they sealed the set 25-12. In interview, Kenya coach Munala said he was happy with the win.

“We can only pick from here going forward. The performance was awesome and the new players were impressive,” noted Munala. Kenya play Rwanda today in their second match as Egypt take on Uganda in other encounter.

In a statement on Saturday, KQ said they have been forced to cancel and delay several flights.

"Our guests remain our highest priority and we will endeavor to ensure any affected guests are rebooked on other flights," they said.

The airline urged travellers to keep checking the status of their flights through their contact center and social media.

KQ has been cancelling and delaying flights since its profits started dwindling last year.

The airline, part-owned by the state and AirFrance KLM, sank into the red four years ago after tourism slumped following a spate of attacks.

Last September, a massive brain drain at the troubled Kenya Airways left the airline's technical department greatly understaffed causing delays and safety concerns.


Months later, engineers downed their tools citing poor pay, lack of promotions and unfavourable shift patterns.

Reportsthat NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga (pictured) has planted spies across the UhuRuto reelection campaign team can no longer be brushed aside. Our mole at the Office of the President confirmed that it has been hard for the team to identify people leaking information to the opposition. It is now a tool used by people competing in UhuRuto’s campaign team to blackmail one another. As a result, some have been transferred and others sidelined. Our mole said President Uhuru Kenyatta’s campaigns are organised by the OP and State House. Most Jubilee officials are not privy to the developments.

Talk of election rigging has reached a crescendo lately. But who is the new IEBC deputy returning officer for Nairobi? Sources whisper to Corridors the man is a board member of a state corporation in charge of ICT. His hiring has raised eyebrows after the IEBC fired the initial deputy returning officer under unclear circumstances after serving for only 55 days. The Nairobi returning officer, himself a former policeman, is said to have mistreated the sacked man and allegedly pocketed some of his allowances. Maybe the IEBC needs to do more due diligence on the recruitment of its officers. Sources whisper to Corridors that the new deputy returning officer initially did interviews to be a deputy RO in Starehe constituency – and flopped. How the IEBC settled on him for the top job raises eyebrows.

===

Jubilee Party officials are finding it hard to traverse the country with President Uhuru Kenyatta, due to logistical challenges. The officials at the OP and State House are not supposed to reveal President Uhuru’s travelling schedule. The OP teams have perfected the art of hiding such information, treating Jubilee officials as potential competitors. But you must know early to plan, have a standby aircraft and several state-of-the-art four-by-four vehicles, as well as security.

The team handling the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta deserves a medal. They have managed to package her as a role model, a leader and a mentor. Any projects she takes part in turns out perfect in the eyes of Kenyans. Her role in hunting for votes for the President might have a stronger and more positive impact on the total votes for the incumbent.

Corridors has established that a gang (Mungiki) in Kiambu bribed officers with more than Sh100,000 to continue with their operation in the town after the Star exposed it. The gang no longer harasses other road users, but it heavily extorts matatu operators on that route. It collects Sh300 every day per PSV and Sh100,000 shillings every Saturday at a stage at Rumathi.
Six players are suspended ahead of this weekend’s Kenyan Premier league matches.

Second placed Posta Rangers is the hardest hit with two of its players set to watch from the sidelines. Goalkeeper Patrick Matasi and defender Luke Ochieng will not be part of the team to face Tusker at Kinoru after picking two yellow cards in their last outing.


Defending champions Tusker will also be without their influential captain James Situma, who has accumulated five yellow cards this season. Situma is one of the players, who has been used mostly by coach George Nsimbe. Mathare United will face Kakamega Homeboyz without goalkeeper Levis Opiyo, who was sent off against Sony Sugar, same as Chemelil Sugar’s Jairus Adira, who will miss the match against Thika United. James Agembe will also not be part of his Chemelil Sugar side following accumulation of five yellow cards.Phares Olwero of Upper hill is tackled Martin Mugo of Laiser hill during the concluded Metropolitan secondary schools sports at Laiser hill on March 26.

Laiser Hill Academy have been cleared to take part in the upcoming East Africa Secondary School games next month in Gulu, Uganda.

Laser Hill were re-admitted back for the regional show following a successful appeal over the ban handed to them earlier last week for allegedly fielding ineligible player.

The former champions were handed suspension for alleged including Ephraim Oduor, a former Kakamega Boys High School student, in their 15’s squad contrary to Kenya Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) regulations.


According to KSSSA secretary general, David Ngugi, “The accused player was a former Kakamega High School player, who failed to produce his original birth certificate, a requirement needed before a player features in the tournament. His former side launched a complain which was successful but Laiser wrote to request the player to be withdrawn from the squad they had given. The player never played in any competitive match. They appealed to the Ministry who accepted.”

The ruling will see St. Mary’s Yala who had embarked on the preparations for the East Africa games wait for the next year’s edition while it was met with jubilation by the Kajiado County-based school. St Mary’s Yala, who finished fourth at the Nationals earlier in April, had been drafted as a replacement for Laiser Hill before the latter won their petition.

The family of a Budalang’i resident hit by a motorcycle in Deputy President William Ruto’s convoy on December 3 has appealed for medical assistance.

John Ajwang, 65, says he and other residents were walking towards Port Mixed Primary School to listen to the DP when he was hit.

He suffered a fractured arm and a broken thighbone. He was rushed to Port Victoria Hospital but was not treated as nurses were on strike.


His family did not have money to take him to Nangina Mission Hospital, Funyula, for surgery so they took him back home.

“He has been living in extreme pain,” his mother Agnes Kundu said.

The family of a Budalang’i resident hit by a motorcycle in Deputy President William Ruto’s convoy on December 3 has appealed for medical assistance.

John Ajwang, 65, says he and other residents were walking towards Port Mixed Primary School to listen to the DP when he was hit.

He suffered a fractured arm and a broken thighbone. He was rushed to Port Victoria Hospital but was not treated as nurses were on strike.


His family did not have money to take him to Nangina Mission Hospital, Funyula, for surgery so they took him back home.

“He has been living in extreme pain,” his mother Agnes Kundu said.

“We are therefore appealing to Ruto to give us funds to take him to a private hospital for surgery because we are unable to afford the cost of surgery.”

The Nairobi government has become the latest beneficiary of getting back illegally acquired land.

The National Land Commission, in a 77-page special July 17, 2017, Kenya Gazette has revoked more than 100 title deeds it believes were illegally acquired.

Politicians, lawyers and businessmen have not been spared by the purge that has affected 102 parcels, most in high-end areas such as Woodley Estate.

NLC says that most of them were reserved for county government housing.


Commission vice chairperson Abigael Mukolwe told the Star that all the affected parties had been given a fair hearing.

“We must follow the rule of law. People who have invaded someone’s parcel have ,according to law, three months to vacate,” she said yesterday in her office.

Another winner in Nairobi county is the Kenya Urban Roads Authority as several blocks within Embakasi have either been revoked or owners asked to surrender seven metres free of charge, reserved for a transport corridor.FACEBOOK

Western deputy regional commissioner George Otieno has asked residents to stock up on essentials and stay at home after voting on August 8.

“You should buy enough food stuff including painkillers to ensure that when you vote and leave for your house you don’t leave your house after voting. This is to ensure that you don’t leave your house to buy sukuma wiki,” he said on Thursday.

“On August 8 leave your house and go to your polling station, vote and return to the house, not even hanging outside the recommended 400-metre radius of a polling station. Movements must be minimised.”

Otieno was speaking during a community dialogue on election and dispute resolutions at a hotel in Kakamega.

The meeting was organised by the Kenya chapter of the International Commission of Jurists.

But speaking after the meeting, ICJ-Kenya programme manager Teresa Mutua said any unprecedented curtailment of Kenyans’ freedom because of the election is unconstitutional.

Kenyans won’t accept it

“Every Kenyan has a right to freedom of movement and association under the Constitution. Elections cannot deprive them of these fundamental rights,” she said.

Mutua said every Kenyan wants a peaceful election, but their rights should not be violated in the name of security.

Kakamega Jamia mosque Imam Ibrahim Sadala said Otieno’s remarks border on declaring an illegal curfew.

“Kenyans will not accept it,” he said.


scare away voters

The forum was meant to provide a platform for wananchi to engage the Judiciary and share their anxieties and fears concerning electoral dispute resolution process.

The meeting was chaired by resident judge Ruth Sitati.

Participants included the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission, civil society members, representatives of the police, prison, provincial administration, politicians and religious leaders.

Lawyer Carolyn Khasoa, who represented the Law Society of Kenya and Fida, asked the courts to set up a temporal registry for election petitions.

Acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i a week ago rubbished the opposition’s adopt-a-polling station strategy to guard its votes.

The Cabinet Secretary said only accredited agents will be allowed in the polling stations.

But the IEBC on Wednesday said police will only eject people from within 400 metres of a polling station on instruction of the respective returning officers.

They can stand beyond 400 metres.

NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga has accused the state of militarising the police to intimidate their supporters .

He said heavy police presence in opposition strongholds — on the pretence they are hotspots — is a ploy to scare away voters.

The appeal of About Thyme Restaurant is three parts ambience, two parts food and, if you happen to live around Westlands, equal parts convenience.

Set at the junction of Peponi Road and Eldama Ravine, this spot has always been a favourite, and the mere thought of going back always elicits pangs of joy, coupled with gluttonous anticipation for all the sumptuous food set to hit my palate with just the right amount of aplomb. Hence, with a table booked out in the garden this past weekend, I met up with a group of friends and family for what turned out to be quite the expectedly pleasant afternoon. Just so you know, on Saturdays, they open from noon till late, and on Sundays, for brunch and lunch only.

I do so love a good garden restaurant. It is just the stuff that idle Sunday afternoons that would otherwise be spent binge-watching whatever shows or movies aren’t being repeated for the umpteenth time on DStv are made of. One vibrant flower and gently falling leaf at a time. Plus, if you are at About Thyme, there is always the chance that a cheeky monkey might clamour down one of those beautifully upholstered gazebos and, with the patrons oohing and aaahing at this ever-so-limber and oddly human-like creature that we apparently evolved from, and kids laughing and clapping their pudgy little hands in glee, it is all quite the welcome spectacle, I might add.

The average cost of a main meal is Sh1,500, and one of my favourites from the charcoal grill section of the menu is the paprika and lemon chicken breast. Picture a tender and juicy chicken breast marinated in a mixture of paprika, cumin and lemon with Ajo Verde, which is a Peruvian-style green chilli sauce, culminating in just the perfect level of zing with a spicy kick, and served with sautéed new potatoes and a medley of grilled seasonal vegetables. Really, the menu is so extensive that you will simply be spoilt for choice. A breakfast fry up, stuffed barbecued pork chops with apple sauce, premium aged beef so tender it will come apart like butter, salads, vegetarian options, a dessert menu that will temporarily knock out your no-sugar diet (there’s even a Kenyan cheeseboard, for all you cheese lovers out there), digestifs, boozy coffee or hot chocolate, and much more.


If you fancy a nice fine dining experience with friends, family or business mates, About Thyme dishes it out just like I like it. But then again, I’ve never quite been a fan of flamboyant culinary expressions such as molecular gastronomy because I am a firm believer that foam, for instance, should only be in soap, beer or hair products, and I would much rather a dish be pleasantly palatable than overtly artistically elaborate. What use is it if you spent 28 days making it if the end results tastes like Ryegrass with a Sh10,000 price tag per menu item? Besides, if you are looking for a family-friendly restaurant, kids just want ice cream, cookies, chocolate brownies and all that other delicious stuff that’s bad for their teeth.

About Thyme is quite popular with big groups, regularly hosting celebrations such as birthdays, bridal showers, graduations and other get-togethers. The space feels intimate but can hold 50 people. You won’t realise that it’s actually that big because seating is spread out indoors, on the terrace and in the garden. If you reserve the entire space, you can comfortably host up to 100 people.

Opened in 2005, this restaurant is the culmination of a lifelong dream for Deborah Swai, who worked as a pastry chef in restaurants in the UK, hence, as she aptly puts it, it was about time. In the 13 years it has been running, she has attracted regular patrons who have been returning for the great food, consistency and good service. They also just won the Tripadvisor 2017 certificate of excellence. On Wednesdays, you can find the saxophone being played by a fantastic band and on Thursdays, you get a complimentary Mojito with dinner. Because, let’s face it, Thursday always calls for a Mojito.

You will love this spot because it is relaxed, laid-back and peaceful. As I took the first bite out of the decadent dessert trio (it’s about Sh650 and is great, if you can’t quite decide which dessert to order. The platter comes with three of the house signatures: chocolate brownie, strawberry cheesecake and banoffee pie), I couldn’t help but be reminded why I always enjoy my dining experiences here.FACEBOOK

When King David et al wrote in the biblical book of Psalms: “For by you I can run upon a troop; And by my God I can leap over a wall”, I don’t think they had in mind the aims of the trio who recently caused early morning hullabaloo on the street where I live.

When over a year ago we moved from a fifth floor flat on Cape Town’s bustling Atlantic Seaboard to one of the leafy Southern Suburbs of the city, we thought life would slow down. In fact, I feared it would be boring. It would seem, however, that we were mistaken.

Living on the fifth floor of a block of flats didn’t lend itself to much drama, other than the occasional noise and traffic chaos in the street below, when there was an event at the nearby stadium. However, our existence in the land of back gardens, complete with grass, trees and shrubs, which don’t properly disguise the high walls and electric fences, has serious potential for excitement.

Just after 1am on Wednesday, our small dogs, which sleep in our bedroom, began to bark. Just as I was about to shush them, my sister-in-law, who lives with us, screamed. At the same time, we heard alarm sirens going off down the street. Before we were fully awake, we heard running on our roof, and as we pressed the panic button, I heard the rattling of the barred security gate that protects the French doors in our lounge. We were under siege.

Within what seemed like a few seconds, an armed response team from the security firm that guards our property and that of some of our neighbours had appeared at our gate, and after we let them in, embarked on a search of the compound, where they found one man leaping over our 10ft high back wall with the ease of a practised Olympic high jump athlete, only without the supporting pole.


Unfortunately for the athletic burglar, the compound he leapt into just happens to be the home of the manager of a security firm whose employees had been patrolling the area as the commotion started in our neighbourhood. That was the end of his run.

Apparently he and two of his colleagues, one got away, had tried to burgle one of our neighbours down the road. When their attack had been foiled by the alarm system and the security patrol in the street, they had tried to escape by bounding over walls, some of them topped off with electric fencing. One of them, had in the manner of the neighbour’s cat, managed to get on our roof in his escape bid.

We were very lucky that the guy on the roof seems to have been light on his feet, because he only damaged our roof instead of crashing through the skylight, which would have literally had him dropping into our lounge. Now that would have been serious drama.

Perhaps if the Olympics introduced a 10ft hurdles race, the burglars might have chosen a different career path. On the plus side, we have now been invited to join the neighbourhood watch.Two weeks ago, this column raised the issue of how far party manifestos — at the presidential level at least — show concern with and understanding of the Constitution, and a commitment to implementing it.

One of the major innovations of the 2010 Constitution was devolution. Many people have their reservations about how devolution has worked out, with particular concerns about devolving corruption. But surveys have generally shown considerable enthusiasm on the part of Kenyans. In September last year, an Ipsos poll showed that enthusiasm was greatest in Nyanza where 86 per cent of people were supportive. Even in the least supportive areas, sizeable majorities approved: 64 per cent in Central and 74 per cent in the Rift Valley.

It is hardly surprising that all manifestos profess support for devolution, saying they would strengthen it.

WHAT WAS THE VISION OF DEVOLUTION?

The Constitution gives a good idea of what devolution is about. Recognising diversity and protecting the rights of minorities and marginalised communities, and thus strengthening national unity, are prominent among the aims. So are promotion of service delivery, and social and economic development, and fairness in the sharing of resources. More transparency in government and more accountability are also important.

The methodology is enhanced democracy, particularly locally, through involving the people in government, and in decisions that are important to them. And this is done by the creation of governments at the county level, elected by the people and accountable to them. Those governments have responsibility for many activities that are central to people’s daily lives, such as health, local transport, agriculture, markets and small businesses, local roads, water supply and sanitation. To carry out the responsibilities they are to have adequate finance—most of which comes from the resources raised by national government, but they have certain powers to raise money themselves, and the financing arrangements are to be designed to encourage this.

WHAT DO THE PARTIES PROPOSE?

Powers of counties

Schedule Four of the Constitution contains a list of the powers of counties. In theory, by now counties are exercising all those powers. Jubilee considers that all functions have been transferred

NASA, however, believes that counties are not yet able to carry out all the functions that were intended to be devolved to them (though it does not list these). It, therefore, proposes to ensure that all functions are indeed transferred. In fact, it intends to pass legislation to clarify the allocation of powers, and also to transfer responsibility for infrastructure for public primary and secondary school to counties. It does not clearly explain why. The Council of Governors annual devolution conference in 2016 said, “County planning and development for electricity and gas reticulation [distribution networks], energy regulation and cultural activities, for instance public entertainment and public amenities such as libraries, have not been fully transferred.”

NASA also proposes that various existing bodies that carry out functions that now straddle the powers of both national and county governments should be reorganised to ensure that they fit with the new system. These include the road boards (Kenya Urban Roads Authority and Kenya Highway Authority), the water boards and the Regional Development Authorities (such as the Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority). Again, the devolution conference last year identified these as institutions carrying out many county functions.

NASA also proposes that the Constitution should be amended to give counties more of a role in security.

Interestingly, Thirdway Alliance says it would abolish the revamped former Provincial Administration — Ekuru Aukot reviving the Bomas and CoE proposals changed by the MPs to the current, weak, requirement to “restructure” it, which has meant mostly re-branding it and its officers.

Resources for counties


Again, Jubilee identifies no issue. It says it has increased the percentage of national revenue going to counties to 34 per cent. This is slightly misleading: The Division of Revenue Act passed last month allocates just over 20 per cent of the 2017-18 money to counties. The 34 per cent Jubilee mentions is of the 2013-14 financial year’s money.

NASA, on the other hand, argues that various strategies have been used to reduce funds to counties, and commits itself to ensuring that the principle of “funds follow function” is observed. Wisely, it does not commit itself to a minimum of 45 per cent of national revenue to go to counties — as it did in the Okoa Kenya campaign in 2015. Thirdway on the other hand says 50 per cent should be transferred.

It is important to be realistic about the financial needs of the national government. It is responsible for the military and police, most education, national referral hospitals, Parliament and the judiciary, railways and airports, major roads, telecommunications, and elections, of course, among other things. These are not cheap. It is true we ought to be spending more on some county matters, especially health. As a country we joined others in Africa to commit to spending 15 per cent of our overall budget on health, but now we spend more like five per cent.

The important issue is to do as NASA says — ensure that we start with the functions and then ask how much they cost. It is also important that counties make efforts to raise their own revenues. When county residents feel counties are spending their money they should be more determined to hold the county governments accountable — achieving some of the important objectives of devolution.

NASA also promises to change the Constitution to ensure that counties and communities share benefits from resources. Jubilee seems satisfied with the law already passed on this (a topic too detailed to go into here).

Improving intergovernmental relations – cooperative government

NASA identifies as an issue poor relations between counties and national government, despite the constitutional principle of “cooperative government”. It promises to organise a conference between levels of government leading to a “Charter” on cooperative governance. And it envisages strengthening machinery for intergovernmental relations, something promised also by Jubilee.

Assisting and strengthening counties

The Constitution requires the national government to support counties. It is important to remember that counties are not local governments in the old sense — subject to the whims of the Minister of Local Government and liable to be sacked or sidelined at any moment. Though governments are “inter-dependent’ they are also “distinct”. This means they must be able to make their own decisions — otherwise, how can they be accountable to those who elected them?

It is not clear how far Jubilee’s promises are designed to strengthen counties. It speaks of a “structured system of conditional grants”. Though they say this would enable counties to enhance capacity to raise their own revenues, drive investment to national priority areas and strengthen their organisational capabilities — valid aims — it is not clear how. Conditional grants take decision making out of the hands of counties, weakening rather than strengthening them and their accountability.

The Jubilee approach smacks rather of doing things to or for counties, rather than with them. This is true also of their one-county-one-product programme intended “to promote development of industries in each county based on products and resource potential that are unique to each county”. Is this based on reality? And how does it strengthen devolution?

Both main manifestos seem to have little idea of how the national and county governments are supposed to interact when it comes to specific programmes. NASA’s extensive plans for agriculture — much of which is a county function — do not mention county governments once. Jubilee does not mention counties in connection with plans to “increase access to sanitation and sewerage by an additional 500,000 households by” — also county functions. It does say it will “work with county governments” when it comes to establishing proper waste management systems.

It seems there is some way to go before devolution is fully understood and “internalised”. Old habits die hard, as does the quest for control over matters that belong elsewhere. Taking initiatives away from the counties in respect of powers assigned to them is hardly respecting the objectives of devolution.

Upcoming fashion designers on Wednesday showcased their creations at the OPPO F3 Black Limited Edition launch.

Various models took to the runway in a glitzy display of style and elegance that was attended by top personalities in Kenya’s fashion and entertainment industry.

Guests took in designs from Ian Omondi and Brian Mathews of Taisere Design, Carol Oyugi of House Korasewn and Hellen Githinji from G_ by Githinji in 2 hours long display at Radisson Blu Hotel.

With Kenya’s fashion industry being one of the most vibrant on the continent, the OPPO Fashion Night was established to showcase how mobile technology has enabled the fashion industry to break new ground in regards to designs, job creation, marketing opportunities and influencing popular culture.Oppo F3 launchA model takes a selfie with guests using the OPPO F3 Black Limited Edition

A prime example of how mobile technology has impacted fashion is the heightened use if social media platform Instagram which has greatly enhanced the popularity of fashion influencers like Diana Opoti and Joy Kendi

“This is a great opportunity to work with a company like OPPO because it is my first corporate collaboration. I’m excited that they believed in me,” said Hellen Githinji.

It’s also fantastic for the fashion industry because it shows it is growing and the opportunities are endless. We usually just have stand-alone fashion shows but to combine a show with a phone launch says a lot,” she added.

With the new OPPO F3 Black Limited Edition offering a new direction in regards to style, OPPO is banking on the device to help them make inroads in the premium smartphone segment.

The designs on the runway were heavily inspired by the device’s matte black colour, sleek curved design and cutting edge technology.

“My inspiration comes from literally anything-be it a picture, a vision or even a phone- I get influenced by what is around us,” said Hellen.

The creations also represent OPPO’s vision of being trendsetters and being at the forefront of technology and lifestyle industries.

“This show is more than just launching the OPPO F3 Black Limited Edition. We are giving new designers the opportunity to show the world what they are capable in a very competitive industry,” said OPPO Mobile Kenya Brand Director Jessie Wu.

“Today’s event mirrors the same philosophy that we take with our products which is being edgy, stylish and catering to various tastes,” said Mr. Wu.

“The matte black colour is in response to our users varied lifestyles and fashion preferences,” he added.

The new version which will be available at authorized resellers comes with a pre-installed screen protector, jelly case, fingerprint reader, a 16 megapixel front camera and a two years official warranty for added value and protection.

The F3’s 16MP lens creates high quality selfie plus an 8MP lens for wide angle group selfies. With both lenses working in tandem, users are guaranteed a new level of selfie experience in the modern and social lifestyle.

It also possesses other leading design features including the ColorOS 3.0 operating system, thin body design with 6-inch screen dual-slot card tray and an octa-core processor backed by 4GB RAM. A 4,000mAh built-in battery gives the F3 and endurance of more than 17 hours.

The worst thing to spread in an election year is fear. It is even worse when the government itself perpetrates this fear.

It was a very big mistake for the Inspector General of Police to release a statement saying that the state is ready to deal ruthlessly with any troublemaker during this election.

A terrifying picture was published on the front page of a daily newspaper showing the IG armed to the teeth, ready to crush any troublemaker at election time.

It was like getting ready to kill a fly with a sledgehammer!

The consequence of all this was fear in multi-ethnic cities and towns such as Kisumu.

Since my dear home city had been identified by the same government as a potential ‘hotspot’, so-called minority communities immediately went into a panic after the IG’s statement.

A group of resident Asian friends invited me to a club and asked me to reassure them regarding their safety at election time.

One of them told me that his family has established a tradition of sending all members of the family on holiday abroad around election period.

The others told me they would close their businesses very early and stay indoors and wait and see what happens.

In effect, there was going to be a business slow down two weeks ahead of the election.

The African workers who registered as voters in Kisumu but come from afar were also likely “to go home” during the polls to avoid being trapped in any trouble.

I was further taken aback when the 23,000 strong Gusii community, most of whom live in the Nyamasaria neighbourhood of Kisumu, also were panicked after Boinnet’s statement.

Criminal and opportunistic elements started warning some of them to take care because “we too are coming for you.”

The daily newspaper that starred the IG on its front page had the caption, “Get ready: We are coming for you.”

This caption/headline went viral among criminals and hoodlums who thrive on fear to advance their business.

In the Nyamasaria neighbourhood they capitalised on it. It took the initiative of the Gusii leaders to call a meeting of community leaders at the Royal Dubai Hotel, where I was the keynote speaker, to address this issue and put it to rest.

The community resolved to stay put during the election, and avoid depressing the NASA voter turnout in Kisumu.

We also resolved to meet the county commissioner and security team to get assurance from the national government regarding security during the polls. A week had not passed before rumour had it that a group of 100 youths were being transported from Nairobi to Kisumu to hold a demonstration.They were said to be wearing orange T-shirts printed with the words “Ten Million Strong: Raila Must Serve for 10 Years!”

The aim of this was to begin instilling suspicion in ODM strongholds that the promise by Raila to serve for one term was hogwash!

During the demonstration, more was to happen with the connivance of a very senior county government official, in collaboration with Jubilee headquarters in Nairobi.

This reminded me of the PNU-inspired post-election violence provocative pamphlets in January 2008, which were printed by the government printers in Nairobi and ferried to the Rift Valley to provoke hatred against ODM.

Fortunately, as the ODM secretary general, I got to know about this in time, informed our security officer, the late Nyaseda, who instructed me to immediately inform David Kimaiyo, the then IG.


He consequently took immediate action and the pamphlet transporters were arrested in Iten before they caused any damage.

Likewise, after getting to know about the demonstrators and their evil intentions in Kisumu this week, our team pounced on them as soon as they started to put on the T-shirts behind Cooperative Bank in Kisumu’s CBD.

They quickly dropped the T-shirts and melted into thin air in the Thursday morning mist. While the T-shirts and posters were seized and burnt by our youth leaders, the county government vehicle which ferried them was seized and handed over to the police.

It is now the duty of the governor to address the county and explain to Kisumu residents why elements within his government are involved in such sinister misadventures. I come back to my theme last week: I fear this election might not be free and fair.

The ruling Jubilee Party is scared that its numbers are not adding up. If they were, President Uhuru Kenyatta would have attended the presidential debate.

He would have been asked the question, “Will you accept the results if you lose?” Uhuru was afraid to be seen on television and to be recorded in full public view, saying that he would do so — in the presence of Raila.

As far as I am concerned, this was the key issue. Others were secondary. But more than that, the centre does not seem to be holding as D-Day faces the Jubilee party; hence, more panic.

Coupled with the immature manner in which some of Jubilee’s business potentates are speaking about NASA leadership, wisdom seems to be eluding the ruling party.

This is not the time to sow seeds of hatred. This is the time to intensify confidence-building power breakfasts, where leaders from the two sides of the political divide commune together.

In the final analysis, leaders in the security and intelligence state apparatuses must help Kenyans. They need to stand tall above the political players and protect Kenya as a nation and Kenyans as a people.

I brought this to the attention of security officials in Kisumu at a meeting we held on election matters.

I was particularly concerned about the buying of IDs in Kisumu county. The aim of this sinister operation is to reduce the voter turnout in NASA strongholds.

I thought that the security and intelligence apparatus would go intooverdrive to stop this damage to our electoral process.

Nothing much has been done.

The residents of Kisumu have, therefore, decided to fight this crime the best way they can.

On Thursday, a former MP was almost killed by the people when he was caught with a bunch of IDs in his office. Earlier, we had found a young woman in Seme subcounty with more than 80 IDs in her possession.

Further investigations revealed the involvement of politicians and local civil servants. The identity of these people is with the police intelligence and we hope remedial action is being taken.

In the final analysis, the government needs to call an immediate ceasefire on its governing through threats — the Fred Matiang’i way — and start governing by confidence-building the George Saitoti way. If there were ever a minister for internal security who knew what his job entailed in a multi- cultural society, it was my late colleague Professor Saitoti. We started off as terrible adversaries during the Moi era but ended up good colleagues in the Narc and Coalition governments.

Even when there was a split in Narc in 2005, and we found ourselves on the opposite sides of the political divide, we continued to compare notes and seek solutions that worked.

I could say the same of my friend Francis Muthaura, who would have been of good service to Jubilee at a time like this.

We need men and women who, notwithstanding their public mien, can promote working compromises at a time like this when the nation stands on the precipice of a possible disaster.IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati after he was sworn in on January 20 Photo/Jack Owuor

Four years ago, at election time, I wrote an article entitled “Time to slay the ‘us’ and ‘them’ monster” and once again, in this election the same narrative is operational. At the writing of the said article, we held our collective national breath for this was the election that followed the infamous 2007 one where blood actually did flow. Its election time again. And all of us are holding our breaths again hoping and praying that the elections in a fortnight will be safe for us, our loved ones and our property.

Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who developed the classical conditioning theory, is famous for demonstrating how learning can be facilitated by pairing a biological stimulus with a neutral non-biological one.

In his experiment, he rang a bell prior to providing food to dogs and observed them salivating. After a while, dogs who initially salivated (biological stimulus) at the sight and smell of food, salivated only at the ringing of the bell (neutral stimulus) even without the food. Thus, the dogs subconsciously associated the ringing of the bell with provision of food. Pavlov also noted conditioning happened faster the shorter the period between the two stimuli; the ringing of the bell and the provision of food.

What does Pavlov have to do with our elections? From 2007, we learned that the stimulus “we have won” (biologically casting the vote) and “elections are stolen” (the neutral stimulus) is followed by flow of blood.

According to Pavlov, if we listen to the narrative that elections are stolen long enough and close enough to the voting day, then blood will flow, even without us casting the vote. This is like salivating without the sight and smell of food.

In this election season, we have heard that “our” team already has 10 million of the 19 million registered votes. The Issack Hassan-led IEBC is gone for we were told that Kenyans had lost confidence in that team.

The Wafula Chebukati-led IEBC is in place, and doubts and aspersions have been cast on its readiness and neutrality to referee this election.

So according to Pavlov, we are conditioned. Whether we cast our votes or not, if Chebukati does not announce “our” 10 million, then surely votes were stolen and, according to prominent economist David Ndii, blood will flow.

To interrogate and apply the Pavlov postulate, we should re-examine who “us” is.


A Somali proverb says: “Me and my clan against the world, me and my family against my clan, me and my brother against my family me against my brother”.

So the proverb insinuates that “us” is relative and could be my tribeman, clansman, classmate, neighbour or other persons, depending on who the “them” is. In Kenya, politicians have told us that “us” is tribesmen.

Recently, this was negated by a comment of a Luo woman, who together with her Kikuyu and Luhya neighbours struggle together to get work to wash clothes at Sh50 and later buy water at Sh20 per jerrycan. The Kikuyu woman noted that it is her Luo neighbour to whom she entrusted her children when she was admitted in hospital for 8 days. The Luhya friend visited and brought her a flask full of tea every day she was in hospital. In this case, the “us” are the neighbours and has nothing to do with tribesmen.

I submit that we, as a nation, are trending on a dangerous ground close to the precipice, and must at all costs avoid falling over the edge. All must play their role.

Politicians should refrain from boxing us into tribal cocoons for their personal gain. The IEBC should be faithful to the Constitution, and ensure they operate in a manner that elicits confidence in the electoral process. But even more importantly, all Kenyans of good will must reject the conditioning that these election will result in violence.

We must be clear that the “us” are people with who we share physical environment such as our neighbours, workmates or classmates and not politicians of our tribe. If this is in doubt, let’s remember that we often observe them, the political “us” group, as they wine and dine together irrespective of tribe. We recently saw this camaraderie in funerals as they sent off members of their “us” group.

Finally, let’s remember that the election will come and go, and we will remain. Actually, whoever we elect should not really make a difference! If you so doubt, check the manifestos of the parties and candidates — they are all the same. Kenya will be a better place for if we vote them in, we will have water, healthcare, education and jobs for all.

So really, should it really matter whom we elect?

Nairobi cannot be managed by an elected governor. It needs an appointed administrator.

I’m not the first to say this, there have been murmurings here and there, similar opinions expressed elsewhere, but these opinions and murmurs have been drowned out by the much louder noises of conventional wisdom.

Just so we’re on the same page, let us look at what conventional wisdom is. It is knowledge or information that is generally accepted as true by the public, but often, it is false knowledge or information. It is also an obstacle to the acceptance of new information, for it has the uncanny ability to resist facts. It does this by opposing the introduction of contrary belief, sometimes to the point of absurd denial of the new information. Conventional wisdom comes about as a result of statements that are repeated over and over, regardless of whether they are true or not. That’s it, conventional wisdom in a nutshell.

So what are some of the repeated statements conventional wisdom dishes out to oppose an appointed administrator for Nairobi? At the top of the list is, ‘In the new constitution, the people of Kenya did not want to be ruled from the centre.’ Okay, granted they did say so, but how does that apply to Nairobi, which is at the centre. Does it make sense to incur costs setting up a ka-mini government within walking distance, in every direction, of every arm of the central government?

And then there’s, ‘Because an administrator is not elected by the people, he or she would be unaccountable.’ Now I’m no expert, but going by that logic, what conventional wisdom is trying to tell us is that because the Attorney General, Inspector General of Police, and all the Cabinet Secretaries were not elected by the people, they are therefore not accountable to the people of Kenya and can do whatever they want. What folly.


If we turned a deaf ear to conventional wisdom, it would dawn on us that an elected official, a politician, cannot effectively manage this city. I mean look at the place, it is diverse, with varying constituent interests. The residents concerned about carbon emissions, commuter trains, and road network accessibility to 5-Star restaurants are not the same residents who would like to continue conducting business on the road, or pick up and drop off passengers in the middle of the street. How can a politician possibly manage this eclectic bunch, make tough decisions where they need to be made? He can’t, because ultimately, decisions made by a politician are based on how it affects his political career, and his chances of re-election. And if you’re going to effectively run this city, know that whatever decisions you make, someone will be upset; either a potential voter or a potential contributor to your re-election fundraising event.

As for an administrator, his job is not to be popular but to administer, bring order where necessary, effect policy where needed. Unlike an elected governor, whose life depends on votes, an appointed administrator would not give a hoot how many boda boda riders would be unhappy because they can’t ride on the wrong side of the road, even if there are thousands of them with voters’ cards.

But, I’m just whistling in the wind here. Conventional wisdom always prevails.

It would be nice, though, stepping out of these echo chambers we like living in to get some fresh air now and then.Voting line

With the count countdown to the elections about to enter single digits... All glovers are off as the aspirants take the final stretch, with the undecided votes having less than a week to make up their minds because every Kenyan must vote and should vote come August 8th....

The FOMO of not voting is real this time around. No single Kenyan who has registered as a voter wants to be left behind. From Mama Mboga, watchie wa mtaa, wasee wa jobless corner, my bar man en all his colleagues, to the guy who drives the big cars and sits in that corner office, the vibe is the same... Everyone wants to vote, everyone is ready to hire the new team that will lead Kenya for the next five years... I haven't met a single Kenyan who is not vibing with the election... Kenyans are ready and I have faith that by the 11th of August, we will have a tenant in the house on the hill and the elections vibe will be a closed chapter, like the WizKid concert...

Talking off the WizKid concert, BBQLive, which happened at the KICC... The set-up was awesome. WizKid finally showed up in East Africa after missing two gigs in Uganda last year... He not only gave a good show but also managed to jump into studio with Sauti Sol... But like any other big event in Kenya, the show did not miss its share of drama. First things first, it rained not heavy but enough to soak up the revellers. Why the organiser did not go for a full dome knowing very well the Kenyan weather is bipolar beats me...

Concert timing was a tricky day... BBQ Live organisers understand that no Kenyans will come for an all-night event by 2pm... The event time needs to be readjusted to 6pm-6am, with first performance not earlier than 9pm... With event gates opening by 5pm or even 4pm... I know Kenyans never keep time but it's always a good idea for any major concert to market/share the event, line up or programme with the customers the same way they push for ticket sales... This will reduce the pressure on the event hosts and organiser, because most of the customers paying and complimentary will know the exact time to be at the venue for their favourite acts or main act...

Communication is very crucial to avoid embarrassing moments, where we have opening acts performing on stage and the crowd is busy chanting like it's a political rally or the nurses strike demanding for their rights... We have had over five major concerts back-to-back this year, with Kenyans paying big money to attend, which is super fantastic...

But we also need to understand no event will happen without hiccups. Plus this is Kenya, hosting five majors gigs doesn't make us experts overnight, so the critics need to appreciate that we are growing in that sector and for the event organisers, they need to definitely up their game... From the stage management, back stage management to how the VVIP, VIP and the regular crowd is handled... Because Kenyans are willing to pay the big bucks, let's not now turn and give them substandard service...


If a promoter is selling VVIP/VIP, they need to provide the full experience. If not, don't lie to the customer because they have social media and they will come for you after the event... As for the ordinary tickets, the only thing I would ask promoters and event organisers is to tighten the security... And not just that but the security personnel must be very professional... It's common knowledge that will have our petty thieves who will invest that 5K and come steal wallets and phones, but that's not an excuse for the event organisers to ignore or cut short-cuts when it comes to security...

But with that said and done, as #TheRaverend, I'm happy with the entertainment scene because a couple of years back, the issues that were being discussed were worse... Events were marketed, Kenyans paid their hard-earned cash, and the artiste was a no-show... The situation was so bad that advance ticketing was a rumour... We have made major moves in regards to concerts and shows, and I believe it's only going to get better...

Concerts are a big deal all over the world, and the Kenyan culture of drinking in clubs only and not attending shows is dead... So the challenge is with the event organisers to just tie up the loose ends and let's take the concert and entertainment business to the next level...

To the Kenyan artistes who perform alongside the international stars, it's not a competition and you deserve your respect, but always have a technical rider that not only includes what you need for your performance, duration of performance, but also the number of people in your time... Before you attend, do the sound check or even sign up your brand to be used to hype/market the event. You must have your full technical rider requirements met and passes for all the band members sorted to avoid drama with the security on the day of the gig... Just agreeing on the performance fee and assuming everything else will miraculously work out is a very big mistake...

But as #TheRaverend, all I can say is we are all learning from our mistakes and it's the little things we take for granted that will mess up all the gains we have achieved in the events/concerts industry. We all have to work together and respect each other's hustle to grow... So let's all accept our mistakes and shortfalls and focus on the next big event...

Talking of another big event, tonight, we have Jamaican star Busy Signal performing live at the KICC... So all you reggae and dancehall fans, see you at the event. And tomorrow at the Carnivore, Koroga is back, with the headline act being the Coco Master himself. So another major win for +254 as we close the month of Julie in style and welcome Mr Agusta, as we gear up for the biggest concert in the 254 that doesn't require any entrance fee and everyone is VVIP, with the only performer being you the voter and the IEBC as the promoter/event organisers... So enjoy your concert-full weekend as we count down to August 8th, all for the love of Kenya!!!Ivorian wildlife agents work on bags of pangolin scales they confiscated from traffickers in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, July 27, 2017. /REUTERS

Ivory Coast has seized three tonnes of pangolin scales and arrested eight people for trading the valuable armour of the world's most trafficked animal, a police chief said.

The small, armadillo-like mammal lives in forests in Ivory Coast and other West African countries. Global trade in pangolin scales is banned under a UN convention, but they are prized in some Asian countries for their use in traditional medicines.

Ivory Coast authorities apprehended the traffickers as they were preparing to deliver the pangolin scales to a Chinese client, the head of the anti-trafficking unit, Thimotee Gnahore, told reporters late on Thursday.

The haul was worth approximately 45 million CFA francs ($80,000) and was the largest ever seized in the West African country, he said.


Anti-trafficking network EAGLE estimated that more than 4,000 pangolins had been killed to produce that amount of scales.

"Investigations continue because behind this operation there are suppliers on the ground who massacre these animals, and then there are the people for whom these scales are important," said Gnahore.

Pangolins are hunted for their meat as well as for the plate-like scales that cover their bodies.The UhuRuto Express Team during campaigns in Nakuru county on July 28, 2017. /AMOS KERICH

Baringo Governor Benjamin Cheboi wants Raila Odinga to simply accept defeat and go home should he lose to President Uhuru Kenyatta on August 8.

Cheboi, who is the chair of the UhuruRuto Express Team, campaigned for Uhuru and DP William Ruto in Nakuru on Friday.

"Raila is headed nowhere and we simply want him to accept defeat and go home after elections," he said in Keringet, regarding the NASA flag bearer's fourth attempt at the presidency.

The team is made up of politicians from Rift Valley who decided to campaign for Jubilee's re-election after losing the April party primaries.

Among those present were Franklin Bett, Julius Kones, Bomet woman representative Cecilia Ngetich and Joseph Ruto.

Others were Uasin Gishu woman MP Usila Ngeny, Mosop MP Stephen Bittok, Sammy Mwaita and Uasin Gishu Senator Julius Meli.

Bett, who lost the Kericho senator bid to Aaron Cheruiyot, said Uhuru and Ruto have an unbeatable development record while Raila has nothing to show for his time in government.

"I know Raila better than everyone here after working with him. I can say with no fear that he does not deserve the big seat."

Cecilia Ngetich said Raila is a "daily complaint" who has sensed he will lose to Uhuru.

"Raila is sure he will lose to Uhuru...that is why he is ever crying foul. We want him to stop misleading Kenyans on non-existent rigging claims and go home to relax."

Both the President and Opposition chief have said they will accept defeat should this be the case on election day.

But Raila has made several claims of rigging, saying the government is going to use the military and that Al Ghurair secretly brought ballot papers from Dubai to Kenya and stored them in greenhouses.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has challenged opposition candidate Raila Odinga to explain his plans for Kenya instead of engaging in blame games and claims of election rigging.

He said Raila should stop employing politics of threats and instead explain how he plans to build on the progress Kenya has achieved in the last four years.

“Our opponents have no credible agenda for Kenya. They cannot tell us they will deliver change when they failed to achieve anything meaningful when they were running the government,” Uhuru said.

He spoke on Friday during his campaign tour of Trans Nzoia, Kericho and Narok counties.

Uhuru's remarks came amid growing allegations by Raila that Jubilee is looking to use the military to rig the elections.

He said the opposition Nasa wants power for the sake of it and not for the interest of Kenyans.

The head of state enumerated his administration's goals saying they were anchored on measurable objectives.

He cited the creation of more jobs for the youth and low prices for basic commodities.

Uhuru said his government has created over 2.4 million jobs in the last four years and plans to create an additional 6.5 million in the next five years.

“We have achieved a lot of progress in the last four years but there is much work to be done and that is why I am urging Kenyans to allow us to continue with the work we have started,” said the President when he spoke in Nairegie Enkare.

He urged voters to turn out in large numbers to re-elect him.


“We want to continue with the work we are doing. We have built the SGR that will pass through Naivasha, Narok, Bomet and Kisumu,” he added when he spoke at Kapkatet, Kericho County.

Deputy President William Ruto said the choice Kenyans have to make on August 8 will be between the development achievements of Jubilee and the empty rhetoric of the opposition.

“Our aim as Jubilee is to transform the lives of Kenyans through initiation of projects that have direct impact on their lives. But if you ask our opponents the plans they have, they will only tell you they want to remove Jubilee from power,” said the DP at Kapkatet in Kericho County.

Ruto told security agencies to continue securing the country because it is their constitutional responsibility.

He said they should not be distracted by opposition propaganda.

“That is your duty and responsibility as stated in the Constitution,“ said the DP.

He said the opposition knows it cannot win the election and that is why they engage in constant propaganda.

“First it was the IEBC commissioners, then it was the BVR, then it was the presidential vote tallying. Now they are blaming the security forces,” said the DP.

He hit at the opposition saying it had no viable alternative because they are owned by corruption cartels.

Ruto claimed the cartel authored Nasa's manifesto that the opposition’s presidential candidate presented to Kenyans.

While speaking in Kitale, President Kenyatta said the government will relocate the Kitale GK Prison which occupies huge tracts of land to within the town’s industrial park.

The prison has for decades hampered the growth of the agricultural town which has huge potential for growth.

The President and his deputy wrapped up their Saturday campaigns with calls for Kenyans to vote for progress.

In Kital.Governor Patrick Khaemba had asked for 1,000 acres.

During campaigns on Saturday, Uhuru said the directive stemmed from his administration's love for the county's people.

"We love you and that's why I have ordered prison land be given to you. By next week you will have it. I want you to experience development like other counties," he said.

The President urged the election of governor candidate Maurice Kakai, whom he said will ensure all of the government's projects in Trans Nzoia are completed.

Khaemba recently accused Jubilee officials of sabotaging development, saying they have denied him the land for the town's expansion.

Also read: Jubilee plans to grab ADC land in Trans Nzoia after August polls - Governor Khaemba

Uhuru also urged the people to choose Jubilee over NASA as they have overwhelmingly transformed Kenyans' lives.

In his address at Kitale stadium, he pointed out that 95 per cent of homes in Trans Nzoia now have electricity.

On health, Uhuru noted Jubilee has equipped Endebes and Kitale referral hospitals with equipment worth Sh8 million that will enable local provision of ICU services, radiology and dialysis.

"You have more reasons to re-elect Jubilee. Patients in Trans Nzoia will not have to travel to other counties to receive special treatment. You have every thing within your reach."

The Jubilee Party leader further noted they will ensure 250 km of roads in Kitale are tarmacked. He said the tender has been awarded and that work will soon begin.

Noting Trans Nzoia is Kenya's food basket, he promised that from December 2017, the price of fertiliser will reduce from Sh1,800 to Sh1,200 per bag.


"When we came to power the price of fertiliser was Sh2,500 per bag. We reduced it to Sh1,800 [we will reduce it further]."

The President was with leaders including DP William Ruto, Kakamega Governor Ken Lusaka and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa.

Ruto said Opposition leaders are liars and that they will never transform the country.

"The entire NASA team was in government before us yet there is no single project they can account for. They should stop lying to Kenyans," he said.

"They should not ride on the backs and track records of others."

The Deputy President further said Raila Odinga na dhis team have no agenda and that they have nothing to offer Kenyans.

"Their manifesto was written by Anglo Leasing thugs. Raila is a fake Joshua...he will never take Kenyans to Canaan," he said. "We have never read anywhere in the bible that Canaan is flowing with beer."

Ruto urged the people to vote for Jubilee candidates for all positions saying they will only experience development if they work with the government.

NASA brigade have planned to tour the county a few days to election to counter Jubilee's campaigns in the region.

Sources in the campaign coordinating team say the ruling coalition is worried about turnout during their campaigns in the county.

Rwanda, the land of the 1994 Genocide in which a million died in barely four weeks, has an election three days before Kenya’s on August 4, but there is not as much concern and nervousness about that poll as there are about Kenya’s in the wider world.

The IEBC’s suspension of the governor campaign in Marsabit county should be commended. The electoral agency is fast-acquiring a reputation for concrete action in real time, something all of its predecessors could only dream about. The IEBC has become so proactive against campaign violence that it has levied million-shilling fines against senior politicians and their accomplices.

There are such high stakes in Kenya’s 12th General Election that every element of violence should be nipped in the bud and the perpetrators given exemplary punishment.


The IEBC needs to do more, more swiftly and remain firm and steadfast.

There are too many reports of violence in places such as Siaya, Migori and Uasin Gishu.

Police expressed fear that other suspects involved in the attack could still be holed up in maize farms in the area.

However, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinett appeared to contradict reports that several attackers were involved.


He said a GSU officer manning the gate to the DP's home was accosted by a lone machete wielding attacker.

According to Boinett, the "intruder" hit the officer severally before gaining access to the home.

He added that the suspect was later forced to hide at a building under construction after reinforcement was called.

“The injured officer is undergoing treatment and is in stable condition. Specialist officers have been sent to deal with the intruder,” Boinett said in a statement.

He said the attack which came at the critical moment when the country was preparing for an election is 'shocking and worrying”.

“It sends shivers in the country given that DP's home is among the well-guarded and that a gunman can have courage to attack baffles."

The Senator called on security agencies to fully investigate the motive of the attack and guard against incidents that may “throw the country into turmoil and uncertainty”.

“Kenyans at this moment want to peacefully participate democratically in electing their leaders and no criminal element or group should be allowed to jeopardize peace at this critical time,” Moi said.

The fight for power has left Mogotio politicians shouting each other down and blocking physical interactions with DP William Ruto.

MP Hellen Sambili was heckled and later blocked from greeting the Deputy President during his tour of Baringo county on Tuesday.

Daniel Tuitoek trashed Sambili in Jubilee primaries and will face KANU's Noah Chepkech in the poll.

The incumbent, who will defend her seat as an independent candidate, has since faced a lot of opposition from her male counterparts.

During Ruto's visit, she was blocked by party chairman Joel Koima from shaking hands with the DP while Tuitoek was allowed to do so.

Jubilee Senator candidate Simon Chelugui, who is from the sub-county, also blocked the DP's ally Reuben Kuborek from greeting him. But Kuborek pushed through the crowd for the opportunity.

Ruto did not shake hands with Sambili before boarding a chopper to leave, stirring varied opinions by members of the public.

"She is an independent candidate. How dare she storm a Jubilee rally to speak at will," shouted resident Haron Chemaina.


Chemaina said the MP should respect residents especially since they have voted for her since 2007.

"Instead of appreciating that she is qualified for a pension scheme after retiring from politics, she wants to come back and force her way to Parliament as an independent candidate."

He asked Sambili to concede defeat and allow people to vote for Jubilee candidates led by Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta.

Mary Kiplimo, who supports Sambili, said it was unfair to shout down leaders and urged residents to respect them.

"You all have the chance to vote them out during the elections. Do not to heckle them in public."

Sambili lost the Jubilee ticket to Tuitoek after garnering 6,015 votes against his 11,994 votes in the primaries on April 24.

She rejected the results and alleged that there were irregularities.

“Names of my supporters were missing in the ballot and my agents were blocked from voting so I will not accept the announced results for Mogotio constituency,” she told the press.

Miguna Miguna says he has not received any communication from Karen Wangenye regarding her decision to no longer work with him.

Earlier on Saturday, Wangenye said she could no longer be Miguna's running mate as their working relations are poor.

Read: Miguna's running mate pulls out of Nairobi race, cites poor working relations

Miguna issued a statement saying: “I wish to note that I have not received any notice, letter or message from Wangenye that she has resigned.”

He noted it is against the Constitution and the Electoral Act for a running mate who has been duly nominated to resign.

On Friday, an Infotrak poll suggested that Miguna had a two per cent probability of being ODM Governor Evans KIdero's successor.

He trailed after Senator Mike Sonko and Kidero who tied at 45 per cent while fellow independent candidate Peter Kenneth was found to have 3.3 per cent backing.

League leaders Kenya Police bid to finish the first leg of the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) Premier League unbeaten when they Parkroad Badgers today at City Park.

The 2013 champions, who are unbeaten so far in the campaign, take on a side who recovered from their poor start to rise again in the standings. Police, who savour a seven-point lead against second-placed Butali Warriors, come to the clash with a mission to maintain the lead. They could also take it to 10 points depending how the western outfit will fare against KCA University.


The law enforcers, who are under the stewardship of Kenneth Kaunda, welcome Robert Masibo who missed a number of games . They are expected to heavily rely on him considering his delivery of quality passes in the midfield.

Kaunda hopes to finish the first leg in unbeaten and hopefully recapture the title from Strathmore University Gladiators. “We have trained well for our final match and we hope to collect all the three points. We are ware it is a crucial match and we are taking it seriously in a bid to safeguard our lead. Badgers are a good team but we cannot afford to lose this one,” said Kaunda. A win for Police will enable them hit their 40th point of the season while a win for Badgers will see them record their 21st point of the season.

Politicians in Lamu should not use inflammatory language that creates hate, fear and tension during campaigns, but instead use words that unite and promote cohesion.

Coast regional coordinator Nelson Marwa (pictured) on Thursday said those who promote hate speech will be arrested and prosecuted.

Campaigns are getting heated, with only nine days to the August 8 General Election.


“People must use a language that brings people together. We don’t care whether you are in Jubilee or NASA. All I care about is law and order since that’s my job. We won’t tolerate people using hate speech and insults all in the name of campaigning. In such a case, the law shall definitely take its course,” Marwa said.

The security coordinator said politicians, irrespective of their party affiliations, have the duty to ensure peaceful and respectful campaigns countrywide.

Marwa warned the youth against being used to cause chaos.

Jubilee chiefs will campaign in Kericho on Saturday in an attempt to contain NASA's gorwing popularity in South Rift.

President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto will hold a rally at Kapkatet grounds.

Via WhatsApp, Governor Paul Chepkwony urged Kericho and Bomet residents to turn up in large numbers and vote for the two on August 8.

Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto (Chama Cha Mashinani) became NASA's fifth principal and has been campaigning for Raila Odinga and his running mate Kalonzo Musyoka.

Unlike Bomet, Kericho is a Jubilee stronghold but Rutto's influence is said to be a threat.

But Jubilee stands a chance as Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter and Senator Aaron Cheruiyot have also been drumming up support for them.

Keter, who resigned about three years ago as Senator, was instrumental in the 2013 general election.

He ensured URP members in Bomet and Kericho declared support for Uhuru and Ruto at the ground in Bureti sub-county.

It is at the same venue that politicians including Mzee Jomo Kenyatta and retired presidents Daniel Moi and Mwai Kibaki were anointed by Kipsigis elders.


The President and DP were also blessed at the grounds before taking office after the last election.

“All roads will leading to Kapkatet historical grounds on Saturday where all JP nominees are expected to converge to declare their final support for re-election of Uhuru and Ruto," Chepkwony said.

Raila and Kalonzo will be in Machakos county while Amani's Musalia Mudavadi, who is in charge of presidential campaigns, will tour Vihiga and Kakamega counties. Ford Kenya's Moses Wetang'ula will campaign in Bungoma where he is Senator.

During a tour of Nyamira on Friday, the President said the Opposition leader is busy abusing the Jubilee administration instead of selling an agenda that would ensure a poll win.

He and the DP tore into Raila and other NASA chiefs on Friday during campaigns in Nyanza and Rift Valley.

Mudavadi told their supporters not to leave voting areas, saying this is part of a plan to reduce the number of votes Raila will get.

Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has accused NASA of planning to disrupt the August 8 general elections by attempting to take youths to polling stations.

Kiunjuri said the youths will shove, intimidate and harass the elderly so they do not vote.

NASA is planning to send 50 youths to each polling station as part of its adopt a polling station plan to secure presidential candidate Raila Odinga's votes.

But acting Interior CS Fred Matiang'i said only presiding officers, deputies, polling clerks and accredited party agents will be at polling stations.

The Opposition's supporters are planning to defy the directive but Kiunjuri said it must be followed to the letter.

“They must know there will be many security officers at polling stations and that whoever tries to disrupt the exercise will probably do it at Kamiti Maximum Security Prison," said the former Laikipia East legislator.

The minister urged Matiang'i to stick to the directive and ensure elections are carried out as expected.

He spoke at Matanya trading center in Laikipia East on Friday when he launched the Inua Jamii programme for monthly stipends for people aged 70 and more. NASA has also promised cash for people aged 65 and above should it form the next government.

Raila has often accused Jubilee of plotting to rig, using the military and even planning a blackout in Kibera and Mathare. The government has denied the claims.

Kiunjuri, who was with Jubilee nominees in the county, urged supporters to vote in large numbers for the Jubilee administration.

He noted 11,500 elderly people in the region will benefit from the Inua Jamii initiative that will start in the county next year.

“Each one will get Sh2,000 every month from the national government. This will happen even if they live for 200 years,” the CS said.

He distributed 500 bags of relief food that included maize, rice and beans to families in Tigithi ward.

Early in July, Kiunjuri said the National Super Alliance is banking on the Judiciary to win the election.

He said Jubilee is sure of a land slide victory and asked the Opposition to stop using other institutions to seek sympathy.

Presidential debates owe their origin to the 1960 first ever broadcast presidential debate between the then Senator from Massachusetts John F Kennedy and incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon, who were trying to succeed Dwight Eisenhower as President.

In Kenya, the first televised presidential debate took place in 2013, featuring ODM’s Raila Odinga, TNA’s Uhuru Kenyatta and several wannabes at the time, who many wondered why they were even included in the two debates at all.

In the US and elsewhere, presidential debates give the leading contenders, usually two, the opportunity to show voters in a large audience, which includes TV, radio and social media all at once, what they’re made of and a real-time comparison of their ability to grasp and address complex or tough questions without losing their cool.

A presidential candidate who qualifies to be invited to debate, is supposed to show that he or she understands the issues facing the electorate and, more importantly, they have solutions they can articulate on their feet that are convincing to the voter for if they cannot do either, they’re not worth being elected to office. There’s also an unwritten rule for a candidate who qualifies to attend these debates, which is that it’s a sign of respect for the voter and a willingness to want to earn their vote.

Debates Media Limited, a consortium of media houses, announced last month that only Raila and President Uhuru qualified to be in the presidential debates this year, which was a good thing. However, only NASA leader Raila showed up on Monday, while Uhuru chose to stay away.

By not showing up to debate Raila, Uhuru proved he was either not prepared for the big show or he just doesn’t think it’s worth his time to answer questions related to his performance as President as a way of re-earning the votes of those who voted for him in 2013 and to add genuine votes beyond what he received. Either of this is contempt for voters of the highest order, for which Uhuru cannot expect but negative repercussions from evertone but his sycophants and those strictly voting on tribal grounds for him and his running mate.


On the other hand, by showing up for the debate and answering tough questions, Raila not only articulated his vision for the country, yet again,but also made an eloquent case of why Uhuru and Jubilee should be sent packing.

Most importantly, Raila once again demonstrated his statesmanship and appeal to voters, who long for leadership driven by vision and conviction and not convenience and pursuit of preservation of self. Uhuru now claims he snubbed the debate because he wants to engage Kenyans “directly” and not through the media.

This is disingenuous at best; what Uhuru’s snub represents is contempt for the voter other than his locked in supporters, who don’t and won’t amount to the majority of those going to the polls on August 8.

For the rest, who are and will be the majority, they will most certainly interpret Uhuru’s not showing up as an admission he cannot defend the abysmal record of his government, he can’t explain the unprecedented mega-corruption of his government, he can’t explain the colossal debt he has burdened all Kenyans with, including the unborn, much of which is already stolen. That he can’t explain the record high unemployment, especially among the youth, and these are but a few hot issues Uhuru knew he couldn’t handle and the real reason he opted not to turn up.

Raila showed up and not only made his case why he still is the man to beat — and no one can beat him — but also showed his humility and readiness to lead despite all that he has endured, including years of detention and torture, and at least twice being rigged out of a presidency he clearly won. Any rational, objective person should and ought to say, “Let the man have his turn this time round”.

In a statement on Friday, communication officer Kihumba Kamotho said the salaries for all the 312,060 teachers have been converted to the new grading structure and individually placed on new pay points.

“The payroll has been run and pay slips uploaded on the online platform for access by teachers,” he said.

The pay was released to various banks and teachers are expected to access the money from today “depending on time taken by different financial institutions to process payment”.

The salary increases are for teachers belonging to the Kenya Union of Teachers and Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers.

The two unions signed individual CBAs with the TSC to cover the period between 2017–2021.

Increased pay

The CBAs were initially to be implemented in four phases, but this was later reviewed following negotiations between TSC and the National Treasury.

The next phase of implementation of the Sh54 billion CBA for 156,000 teachers in lower grades will begin on July 1 next year.

The final phase of implementation for the remaining teachers in higher grades will be paid out on July 1, 2020.

In addition to the new salary structure, teachers will continue drawing all the applicable allowances.


“TSC would like to thank teachers for their patience and understanding during the negotiation and implementation process,” Kamotho said.

The new pay structure has grades B5, C1-C5 and D1-D5, with B5 being the lowest, “C” mid-level and “D” the upper-level grades.

Previously, teachers were graded in Job Groups G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q and R.

The P1 grade was abolished and teachers in Job Group G upgraded to Job Group B5 (former Job Group H), while those in Job Group H will move to Grade C1 (former Job Group J).

The lowest paid teacher in grade B5 will earn between Sh21,756 and Sh27,195 up from the previous Sh16,672 and Sh21,304.

Teachers in grade C1-C5 will earn between Sh27,195 to Sh33,994 up from Sh19,323 to Sh26,442.

The highest paid teachers (grade D1-D5 ) will now earn between Sh131,380 and Sh157,656 up from a previous salary scale of between Sh109,089 and Sh144,928.

School principals, their deputies and senior teachers fall in this category.

Their salaries are pegged on responsibilities and accountability rather than academic qualification.

This means a teacher who holds a master’s degree can earn less than a teacher with a degree or certificate who holds an administrative position.Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe speaks during a press briefing at the Union building in Pretoria, April 8, 2015. /REUTERS

Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe on Saturday said he was not stepping down nor dying and that there was no one with his political stature who could immediately take over from him.

The 93-year-old leader has been in charge in the former British colony since independence in 1980. His health is closely watched by Zimbabweans, who fear the country could face chaos if he dies without anointing a successor.

Mugabe told tens of thousands of supporters at a rally in the town of Chinhoyi, in his home province, that doctors were recently surprised by his "strong bone system."

He has traveled to Singapore three times this year for what officials say is routine medical treatment.

"There is the issue that the president is going. I am not going," Mugabe told supporters on the grounds of a local university, 100 km (60 miles) west of the capital Harare.

"The president is dying. I am not dying. I will have an ailment here and there but bodywise, all my internal organs ... very firm, very strong," Mugabe said as he leant on the lectern. Mugabe, who looks frail, had walked onto the stage slowly but without assistance.


The issue of who will succeed Mugabe has deeply divided the ruling party, with two factions supporting Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Mugabe's wife Grace.

On Thursday, Grace challenged Mugabe to name his preferred successor, to end divisions over the future leadership of ZANU-PF.

She repeated the call on Saturday, adding that Mugabe would lead the process to choose his eventual successor.

Mugabe said although some party officials wanted to succeed him, he saw no one among his subordinates with his political clout to keep the party united and fend off a challenge from the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change.

"A new man will not have the same stature and the same acceptance as I have managed to secure for the party over the years," said Mugabe.

Every leader has insecurities. For instance, some leaders don’t like to be outshined by any member of their team. In their sphere, they must be the ‘best’, ‘smartest’ and have the final say. If someone smarter comes along, they would have problems. It’s one reason such leaders surround themselves with yes-people – they won’t tolerate being questioned on their turf. Their ideas are the ‘best’ and that’s it. These leaders are only interested in gathering followers. Ultimately, this attitude works against innovation because of the nature of change.

Successful innovation requires that you don’t just attract followers, but grow leaders – and this calls for a different mindset from that of simply leading followers. To grow and lead leaders, you first must abandon the traditional leadership framework of ‘getting all you can, canning all you get and sitting on the can.’ It is essential to have or develop a passion for empowering others. You should understand that lighting the candle of others doesn’t mean that your light would go out.

In the innovation process, empowering others to lead multiplies team effort. Leaders that lack this insight find out that progress of their projects is often slow because every tiny detail must be approved by them. Team members are not free to make judgement calls at critical moments because they would be penalized by their insecure boss. This leadership style kills team morale. Also, skilled professionals feel frustrated and insulted when their work flow is frequently interrupted in the bid to micro-manage them.


To grow leaders, you should be intentional about it. You ought to make a quality decision to develop a growth plan for your team members. This should be part of your innovation strategy because who they are has to change for the innovative idea to work. New ideas demand that we expand in scope and leaders ought to take advantage of this to grow their team. So, what is your plan? How do you intend to transform your followers into leaders?

Currently, the pressures in business means that it’s unwise to be the only ‘leader’ in your team. For exponential growth, every member of your team ought to know how to be effective leaders, their roles irrespective. That way, you’re confident that the project isn’t dependent on one person. Anyone can step up to the plate when needed and the project can go onseamlessly. So, do yourself a favor, empower those around you to be strong leaders. You will be stronger for it.

The IEBC yesterday said it has identified key concerns raised by Kenyans and is ready to announce results per constituency as they trickle in.

“We had planned to announce the total results at the national tallying centre because our officers have already made them public at the constituency level, but Kenyans want us to announce as they trickle in,” chairman Wafula Chebukati said at Bomas, Nairobi.

Bomas is the national tallying centre for the August 8 polls.

Chebukati defended the IEBC’s relationship with acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i, arguing that he heads a docket that is key to peaceful polls.

He promised that the number of spoilt votes will not be as many as in the 2013 election as the electoral agency has conducted sufficient civic education. Officials found compromising the polls will face the law.

At each polling station, IEBC officials will identify potential voters and cross out their names on the register.

“The voter will place fingers on KIEMS scanner, retrieve his/her details and then the clerks will call his name before he/she proceeds to be issued with the ballot papers,” Chebukati said.

Register is clean

Dead voters will not take part in the exercise because the Kenya Integrated Election Management System will identify genuine voters.


“In case the device fails to recognise you as a voter, you will have to sign a form, which will also be signed by IEBC officials and other agents at the polling station,” he said.

There will be no collusion between parties and ballot paper suppliers to print extra papers because all ballot papers will have serial numbers at the national warehouse, at the constituency and polling stations.

These will be reconciled after voting.

There will be no deliberate or erroneous tabulation of results at the tallying centres to inflate or deflate the number of votes because KIEMS will be used.

IEBC officials have been trained in how to use KIEMS, which has the dual sim capacity to minimise downtimes of a weak internet signal and is supported by back-end data.

The polling station remains the true locus for the free exercise of the voters’ will.

“The votes cast at each polling centre shall be counted, tabulated and the outcome announced without delay by the presiding officer,” Chebukati said.

He said they have employed a strong team of experts to ensure their servers are not hacked.Riot security forces take position while clashing with demonstrators rallying against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, July 28, 2017. /REUTERS

Venezuelan protesters blocked streets on Saturday in a last-ditch effort to derail the election of a legislative super-body that opponents of President Nicolas Maduro say will give the socialist leader a stranglehold on power.

The oil-rich but recession-racked country has been gripped by four months of protests against Maduro that have left more than 110 dead in confrontations against security forces who have responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons.

"Extend the barricades until tomorrow and everybody go to the streets on Sunday to demand the transformation of Venezuela," Freddy Guevara, an opposition congressman, said on Twitter.

Caraqueños, as residents of capital city Caracas are known, woke to the sight of debris-strewn streets where demonstrators clashed with security forces during the week. Those who are against Maduro's brand of socialism said they would not vote in Sunday's election aimed at selecting the "constituent assembly."

"I'm not going to vote tomorrow. I'm going to stay home, watch TV series and then come out to join the protests, of course," Margarita Lopez, a physician's assistant in Caracas, told Reuters as she stood by one of the barricades.

"It might not do any good, but our voices have to be heard."

The government has banned protests from Friday to Tuesday, but opposition figure Henrique Capriles called on his followers to hold protests along the country's main roads on Sunday.

Among the axed are the women’s relay trio of Maureen Jelagat, Veronica Mutua and Jacinta Shikanda, alongside the men’s relay runner Alphas Kishoyian.

World 400m hurdles champion Nicholas Bett and his hurdling brother Aron Koech also faced the unfortunate axe as well as triple jumper Elijah Kimitei and 800m runner Michael Saruni.

While visiting the team at the their residential training camp at the Moi Stadium, Kasarani, AK president Jack Tuwei said six of the athletes could not meet the qualification criteria as earlier expected while Bett remained injured with Koech’s entry facing system complications.

“The relay runners were provisionally entered for London since we thought they had a chance to qualify for the championships but this never came to be,” said Tuwei.

He added that the men’s team never made the entrants’ list on ranking basis where they were to qualify within the 9-16 positions but could not make the time despite having finished ninth at the Bahamas World Relay Championships.

“Bett was taken to Nairobi Hospital earlier in the week where it was confirmed that he is still injured and thus could not make the team,” added Tuwei.


“As for Koech, there were issues with his entry into the system and we are still following up on the matter with the IAAF competitions department and we will continue doing it and hopefully he can make the trip to London.”

“Saruni was dropped after the technical team found that he is not in the right shape for the competition,” added Tuwei, settling the long-standing debate on the country’s representatives in the two-lap race.

Kenya will now be represented by Emmanuel Korir, world junior champion Kipyegon Bett, Olympic and defending world champion David Rudisha and Ferguson Rotich.

Tuwei said they will field one of the last two as a wild card holder while the rest are as per the federation’s preference, disregarding their 1-2-3 rule.

He added that the axed athletes will still benefit from kitting and local allowances just like the traveling party.

Tuwei revealed that Kenya will send 49 athletes and 26 officials to London in their quest to defend the world title they won during the previous edition held in Beijing two year ago. The team leave in two batches— the first on August 1 and the last on August 6.A street in Mandera town where a man was killed by suspected al Shabaab militants. /FILE

Al Shabaab hijacked a vehicle belonging to a Jubilee campaign team in Mandera on Saturday, forcing negotiations with Somalia elders.

Mandera South OCPD Charles Chacha said the driver was on his way back to Bore Hole 11 town after dropping supporters at Falama area when the fighters ambushed them.

Chacha said the terrorists stopped the vehicle and ordered the four people who were inside to get out.

"The men got out of the car and the militia sped off with the vehicle," he said, noting nobody was injured.

The OCPD said the Jubilee-branded vehicle belonged to a former civic leader in the area.

“The issue has been taken over by our military inside Somalia where negotiations are ongoing," he said.

"We want to get to the root of this problem," he added, saying the were questioning the four people. "We are interrogating them to know what the militia told them and some other issues."

Al Shabaab, which is fighting to overthrow the Somali government, has launched a series of deadly incursions in Kenya.

Last month, more than eight police officers were killed in separate bomb attacks in Garissa and Mandera counties.

Five officers in Governor Ali Roba’s convoy were killed when their Land Cruiser ran over an improvised explosive device between Arabia and Lafey in Mandera.

In Garissa, three AP officers were killed and five others injured when their vehicle ran over an IED on the Kulan-Liboi road, seven kilometres from Kulan, Garissa county.

Al Shabaab militants claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Predictably, there is plenty of media chatter over President Uhuru Kenyatta’s decision not to participate in the televised debate, handing the stage to his opponent Raila Odinga.

However, it is crucial that this discussion be done in its correct context. TV debates between electoral candidates are invariably little more than a cosmetic exercise. Few candidates ever deliver a ‘knock-out blow’ to their opponent. There is little evidence that broadcast debates actually alter the minds of voters. In fact, they are much more likely to simply entrench existing views.

Having said that, broadcast debates are a useful tool for engaging the electorate. But fortunately in Kenya, we have a public that is already extremely invested in political discussions. As such, perhaps the absence of custom-made television soundbites is no bad thing. It means that public attention can remain focussed on the real debate, the real choice facing our country on August 8.

It is a stark choice between two presidential hopefuls. Any rational analysis of the candidates tells a clear story. One has a clear record of spearheading progress for this country. The other has a track record that is not only devoid of achievement, but is intrinsically tied to some of the darkest chapters in our history.

President Uhuru’s last four-and-a-half years at the helm speak volumes. Countless women and their babies have benefitted from free maternal healthcare. Millions of Kenyans have seen their horizons expanded exponentially by being connected to the electricity grid. Meanwhile, newly paved roads and a high-speed railway are making this country more accessible and profitable. In just a short space of time, Uhuru has fixed so much of what has been holding Kenya back.

But in contrast, Raila has been in government for decades, with precious little to show for it. Can anyone list the signature achievements or projects from his five years as Prime Minister?

And even though Raila served as Roads minister, it appears that Uhuru has been left to pick up the pieces, paving a massive 9,000km since taking office. Meanwhile, the Kibera area, which Raila represented in Parliament for more than 20 years, remains destitute, left to live off Raila’s empty promises of improvement.


Lack of achievement would be bad enough, but Raila’s long career in public service is also synonymous with some of the most damaging moments in our recent history.

Raila has manifestly failed to explain his involvement in the 1982 coup attempt against the Moi government, an act of subversion that cost hundreds of Kenyan lives. And in 2007, his call for “mass action” was a trigger to the tragic violence that ended so many lives and turned Kenyans against one another. Raila’s record is also plagued by scandal, as noted by the television debate moderators. The various episodes associated with his name – the Kisumu Molasses Plant, Triton Oil and the Kazi Kwa Vijana programme – have become shorthand for the corruption problem still facing this country.

And so it is no wonder that Raila’s plans, should he enter State House, spell yet more danger for this country. He has pledged that within 100 days in office, he would do away with the direct election of President in favour of an undefined “hybrid parliamentary system”. This is nothing less than the destruction of the social contract between the people and the President and as such, our very democracy itself.

Meanwhile, as he reiterated on stage, Raila also insists that he would pull Kenyan troops out of Somalia. This reckless scheme would endanger Kenyans, bringing al Shabaab closer to their homes. It would also seriously damage our foreign relations with regional and international allies committed to tackling terror.

All these contrast sharply with Uhuru’s determined plan for progress, if he is reelected. It includes a nationwide programme of youth internships, which already has the backing of big business. And it also promises to bring free secondary education for all, and an expansion of maternity healthcare, initiatives that have already been valued. In short, Uhuru is offering a realistic yet ambitious blueprint for all Kenyans to progress.

If anything, the circus surrounding television debates tends only to muddy the clear waters. They allow slick rhetoric and attention-grabbing phrases to blur what is a very clear choice for the electorate. Even without the aid of a staged televised event, anyone who cares to give even a cursory glance at the respective records and plans of the two presidential candidates will see a clear choice between two contrasting future paths for our country. It is either Uhuru the fixer, or Raila the destroyer.Scientists have created crisps made from jellyfish that are more healthy and potentially tastier than potato-based varieties.

Gastrophysicist Mie Pederson, from University of Southern Denmark, has created a new method of drying out jellyfish to the point where they almost resemble regular potato crisps.

"Actually there is nothing new in eating jellyfish," said Miss Pederson.

"It's an old tradition dating back more than 1,000 years in Asia. Jellyfish are a delicacy, believe it or not. I researched how to turn slimy jellyfish into a crispy chip."

The method sees the jellyfish placed in alcohol which in turn extracts the water from the animal.

"In the course of a couple of days, the alcohol replaces the water in the jellyfish," added Ms Pederson.

"In the subsequent evaporation process they become bone dry.

"Gels respond differently when put in different solutions. In alcohol some gels simply collapse, and that is exactly what we see a jellyfish doing.

"As the jellyfish collapses, the water is extracted from it and its volume is reduced.

"After we let it evaporate, a crispy chip emerges that we can eat."


Traditional processes of drying out jellyfish use kitchen salt and alum to extract their water — but it takes 30 to 40 days.

It also gives the jellyfish a crunchy texture rather than a crispy one.

Not only does the new method speed up processing, it could make jellyfish more attractive to Westerners.

"The mouth feel and the aesthetic appearance in particular have gastronomic potential," added Miss Pederson.

The end result produces a crisp that is healthier than traditional varieties. A 25g potion of crispy jellyfish contains 0.5g of fat, whereas a bag of ready salted crisps contains

Jellyfish are also rich with selenium, known to reduce free radicals and fight the aging process and also thwart off prostate cancer.

However, a bag of jellyfish crisps contains a whole day's worth of a person's recommended salt intake but scientists believe more could be done to reduce this.

You could say that jellyfish is an overlooked delicacy, offering lots of opportunities because our seas are teaming with them.

Global warming is believed to have contributed to rising numbers of jellyfish migrating to previously cooler waters as the seas become warmer.

The dangerous Portuguese Man Of War jellyfish has been spotted along the south west coast of England and more are expected to arrive as the planet warms.A rest place for weary souls

We sat on the open verandah, looking out over the magnificent scenery before us in a beautiful valley, with the Mbagathi river flowing past interesting rocky outcrops with many green trees. The sound of water flowing below us combined with the songs of many birds was a therapeutic medicine for weary souls.

It was hard to believe we were so close to Nairobi, and yet it seemed so far, as we sat in this timeless wonderful place called The Emakoko. Positioned on the edge of the Nairobi National Park near the Hippo pools, it is a great “getaway from it all” place to “escape from the city".

Why spend hours getting tired while driving to some distant retreat, when you can simply enter the Nairobi National Park and spend a night or two at this enchanting green emerald called The Emakoko?

The lodge accommodation includes 10 magnificent cottages and is well designed to blend in with the surrounding environment. I experienced an ambience of almost being “at home” with hosts Anthony and Emma Childs in this family-owned place, along with their very friendly and yet efficient staff.

Game viewing opportunities are really great, as the Emakoko has vehicles to take guests on drives with the knowledgeable guides. Kenyan residents and East African citizens also qualify for seasonal reduced rates.


The Emakoko is truly a priceless green gem set in an incredible natural place that simply restores weary souls. Yes, it is time to get a healthy dose of this “soul tonic”.

Kisumu ODM woman representative candidate Rosa Buyu on Friday condemned what she called an alleged plot to assassinate her rival Grace Akumu.

She said the claims should not be taken lightly and urged police to swiftly investigate and charge suspects.

However, Buyu also urged police to investigate if the allegations could be “mere lies” used by Akumu to seek popularity and gain sympathy.

Akumu is the widow of Dennis Akumu, a former trade unionist and Nyakach MP.

Akumu has alleged her opponents are plotting to kill her before the August 8 polls. She did not name them.

Akumu, Buyu and Hildah Adhiambo (Independent) are in the woman MP race. Incumbent Rose Nyamunga is not seeking reelection.


The leader of Citizens’ Convention Party reported the alleged plot at Kisumu Central police station on Tuesday.

Akumu said 16 people have been trailing her and she has information they have been contracted by her rivals. She linked the plot to her “growing popularity”.

Buyu called the allegation “highly regrettable” because women have struggled to enter the political spotlight.

“We can’t condone attacks, intimidation and harassment against women in politics. Police should do what it takes to unearth the truth,” she said.

Buyu told the county security team, led by Maalim Mohamed, to protect women candidates “because they are prone to [be victims of] political violence”.

“Police should live up to their promise and ensure our safety as per the resolution reached with candidates,” Buyu told the Star on the phone.ASA principal Kalonzo Musyoka on Friday said Kitui governor candidates David Musila and Charity Ngilu will get influential CS jobs in the NASA administration if they lose on August 8.

Ngilu (Narc) and Musila (Independent) are facing off against incumbent Julius Malombe.

“Hon Ngilu will get a substantive Cabinet post. I’ve spoken to Musila and told him he will get a powerful docket like being the Transport CS,” Kalonzo said.


He said the two leaders would not be allowed to disappear into the political abyss. Kalonzo spoke during a morning talk show on Musyi FM radio station. He said that as the Wiper leader, he has to back Malombe’s bid, but that does not mean he is against Ngilu and Musila.

“I’ve told Hon Ngilu that she is the Narc leader and I’m the Wiper leader. I, therefore, have to campaign for Malombe — my party candidate,” Kalonzo said.

He also said he is impressed that Kamba leaders have come together in unity of purpose for the community’s benefit, praising Ngilu, Governor Kivutha Kibwana and Wavinya Ndeti for the role they played to make it a reality.DP William Ruto and President Uhuru Kenyatta at a public rally in Borabu, Nyamira county, yesterday

President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto yesterday urged Kenyans to reject NASA presidential flagbearer Raila Odinga because he lives on rhetoric.

The leaders said Raila is busy rubbishing their administration instead of selling an agenda which will guarantee his election next month. UhuRuto spoke yesterday at Nyansiongo, Borabu constituency, Nyamira county.

The head of state urged Nyamira residents to vote in Jubilee based on their track record in the last four years.

“The Jubilee administration has done a lot in the four years since we took power, and that is why we are urging you to reelect us to complete the journey we started in 2013,” the President told hundreds of residents who turned up.

Uhuru also accused Raila of interfering with acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i’s work.

“We are telling Odinga to compete with me and my deputy instead of attacking Matiang’i for discharging his duties. He should compete with us in politics,” Uhuru said.


He questioned why Raila dislikes Matiang’i and yet when he goes to seek votes in Kisii region he says he is at home.

Matiang’i, Jubilee’s Nyamira governor candidate Walter Nyambati, senator aspirant Joseph Kiangoi and other candidates were present.

Uhuru said his government has allocated Sh800 million for Nyamira county in the last four years for health services.

He said no government has ever provided free maternity since the country attained Independence in 1963.

Ruto said NASA has been trying to stop the election but the courts have scuttled their plans. Matiang’i said he will not be intimidated and will serve Kenyans to the best of his ability.


Devolution CS Mwangi Kiunjuri has accused NASA of planning to disrupt the August 8 election by taking youths to polling stations. Kiunjuri said the goons will be used to shove, intimidate and harass the elderly so they don’t vote.

The CS said the law must be followed to the letter. “NASA is planning to send 50 youths to each polling station in what it is terming ‘Adopt a polling station’. They must know there will be a lot of security officers at the polling stations and whoever tries to disrupt the exercise will probably do it in the Kamiti Maximum Prison,” said the former Laikipia East MP.


He spoke at Matanya trading centre, Laikipia East constituency, yesterday where he launched the Inua Jamii initiative. Kiunjuri urged acting interior CS Fred Matiang’I to ensure voting is conducted as expected.

Laikipia North MP Mathew Lempurkel on Friday told a Kibera court that President Uhuru Kenyatta threatened his life.

The lawmaker said that while addressing a rally at Ngenia Secondary School in his constituency on Thursday, Uhuru said he will deal with him “head-on”. Lempurkel further claimed the President said, “Tuondoe hiyo shetani”(Let’s get rid of that devil”).

He said he fears for his life following the verbal attack, describing Uhuru’s remarks as a form of harassment, intimidation and allusion to assassination.

Lempurkel claims that as head of state, Uhuru has all apparatus at his disposal to make good his threat.

The MP is facing charges of racial contempt and incitement to violence.

He denied the two counts, saying he is the victim of a witch-hunt.

The lawmaker says the case against him is meant to cause him psychological torture because of his political affiliation.

Police allege that on July 19 this year at Muwaraki (Posta) in Rimuruti, Laikipia county, the MP made racist remarks in Samburu language.


It is alleged he said, “On August 8 when I am announced, Lekoipen announced, Raila announced, the whites will start migrating. Some locals even called me to ask the government when we are selling the land. I told them to wait for the government of this guy from the water [lake region] because that is what we are waiting for.”

Through his lawyer Ben Sihanya, Lempurkel said he is entitled to a fair trial.

“The legislator was arrested in Laikipia county and was taken through five counties to be brought here in Kibera to be charged, which is out of the jurisdiction for this case,” he said.

He asked the court to release the MP on a Sh300,000 bond, as it did on Monday.

State lawyer Mary Wang’ele objected, saying the terms should be enhanced considering the seriousness of the offence.

But chief Magistrate Joyce Gandani released him on the same bond, warning him that if he makes inciteful remarks the bond will be cancelled.

The case will be heard on September 5.President Museveni being presented with a signed Everton jersey by SportPesa Kenya C.E.O with Pavel Slavkov, SportPesa Tanzania C.E.O looking on.  /COURTESY

SportPesa’s entry into Uganda inched closer yesterday when President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni hosted a delegation from the gaming giants at State House, Entebbe.

The SportPesa officials were joined in the meeting by the country’s Minister for Sports, Nakiwala Kiyingi, Federation of Uganda Football Associations (FUFA) President, Moses Hassim Magongo and other leaders, where the parties discussed sports development and regulation of the country’s gaming industry.

“The group seeks to help the government empower the youth through football and increase revenue by strictly regulating betting,” President Museveni said.

SportPesa CEOs, Captain Ronald Karauri (Kenya) and Pavel Slavkov (Tanzania) presented to the Head of State a signed English Premier League side Everton jersey.


“ I thank them for my gift of a ball and a shirt autographed by the Everton manager, Ronald Koeman,” President Museveni added. “The meeting was successful as we took another key step towards bringing SportPesa to Uganda,” his Minister for Sports, Kiyingi, who led a Ugandan government team to visit SportPesa headquarters in Nairobi last week to lay ground for the State House Entebbe meeting, added.

Besides opening their doors for the SportPesa gaming business and investment in sports, the Ugandan Government is also seeking to partner with the firm to regulate the industry as it seeks to change its legislation to accommodate its entry. The country has been grappling with loss of revenue due to the proliferation of betting shops that seem to evade paying taxes.

“We discussed their issues in the gaming industry which they have tried to deal with by imposing heavy taxation to no avail and how we can support sports including having Ugandan teams in the SportPesa Super Cup if we were in the country,” Karauri underscored.

“With good online gaming regulation, the Government will earn revenue which can be used to empower the youth so that they can stop spending their days in sport betting kiosks and grow to engage in meaningful activity,” Karauri added.Independent Uasin Gishu governor candidate Bundotich Kiprop (Buzeki)is campaigning door to door and ignoring NASA’s backing of Governor Jackson Mandago.

Buzeki campaigned in Kapseret and Turbo subcounties on Thursday, assuring supporters he remains focused. He did not comment on the endorsement

Latest opinion polls gave him a 54.2 per cent lead against Mandago’s 42.2, with 10 days to the polls.

“It doesn’t matter who is saying what. The important thing is that the people of Uasin Gishu will decide who will lead them,” Buzeki said.

Analysts say NASA’s backing of Mandago may give him Luhya and Luo votes in Eldoret.

But Buzeki met with elders from the two communities who assured him of their support.


Mandago has welcomed the move by NASA chiefs to endorse him and hinted at running for a “top national seat” in future.

He said the NASA principals know he is one of the best governors in the country. “Our friends from NASA do not have a governor candidate, but they have seen my good work. That is why they have said I should get another five years,” he said.

NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga did not comment on Mandago but all four other principals endorsed him.

Mandago spoke in Eldoret on Thursday when he met the Somali community. He said he is still in Jubilee, but NASA leaders are within their democratic rights to back him.

Mandago’s declaration that he may run for high office can put him on a collision course with DP William Ruto, who wants to run for President in 2022.Residents of Kipngwe area sho the media the unsecured site wher the toxic asbesto was buried by the Sonata Kenya Limited.Photo by Musembi Nzengu

Nema appears to have been jolted by the threat of a lawsuit by the Kitui government.

It has dragged a director of Sonata Kenya Ltd to court, weeks after the county complained about the firm dumping toxic and carcinogenic asbestos waste.

Director Noah Khaemba was charged with violating a licence to dispose of the waste and failing to comply with a Nema order to restore the areas where the asbestos was disposed of.


He pleaded not guilty before Kitui principal magistrate Johnson Munguti

Khaemba was released on Sh200,000 bail.

The case will be mentioned on August 4, while the hearing will be on October 10.

In terms of correspondence, only the military can definitively answer as to the authenticity of documents tabled by Raila Odinga yesterday. Raila is himself a fraud. Anything being given out by Raila Odinga could just be as fundamentally fraudulent as he is.

Is it news to Raila that our military undergoes continuous training? Every day the military trains. Actually, Raila should be told that even the British military is training in Nanyuki. Does he have a problem with that also? What problem does Raila have with the military – or any other security forces – training for any assignment?

The military is in continuous training: Therefore saying people are being trained is rubbish. Kenyans should ask themselves, what is this inherent fear in Raila with the security forces maintaining peace and security for Kenya during this electioneering period?

Al Shabaab could strike during this electioneering period and they know all the focus is now on elections. Isn’t this the most vulnerable time to be attacked? I think that is why acting Interior CS Fred Matiang’i has maintained, properly advised by the security people, that you cannot lift the curfew that is in place in Lamu, Garissa and Mandera. Why? Because it’s the most vulnerable time.

So what problem does Raila have with the country being secured? Is it because he has been planning to use violence to cause despondency in this country and get power through the back door? Raila should concentrate on pleading with Kenyans that, this time, they give him their votes, not propagating lies. He knows he is going to lose this election.


Who said the military are being involved in internal operations? Has anybody said that? Has anybody in the military confirmed that? Does Raila’s fake correspondence confirm that the military is being used for internal operations?

It’s up to the military to confirm the authenticity of the documents. What can’t you do in this day and age with all the digital technology? You can forge and fake anything. Leave the military, the police and other security forces out of politics.

We shall never involve the military to win an election. He is the only one who is on record as having tried to use the military to attain political power. For us, consistently over the years, we have used the ballot. As for our military officers, we also ask them to vote for us.Lawyer James Orengo during the hearing of a case in which NASA challenged the ballot paper tender award to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company at the Milimani law courts, Nairobi, on June 27 /COLLINS KWEYU

NASA has appointed Senator James Orengo as the its chief agent for the August 8 election.

The alliance said on Friday that Orengo, who is also defending his Senate seat, will be deputised by NASA chief executive officer Norman Magaya.

Magaya, a lawyer, will also serve as the alternate chief agent in the epic presidential contest, which is projected to be a tight race between Jubilee candidate Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga.

In a statement by Joe Ager, the Head of Operations and Delivery at the NASA Campaign Secretariat, said the alliance has submitted the names of Orengo and Magaya to the IEBC for accreditation.

Ager added that the early appointment of Senator Orengo as the NASA chief agent represented a critical part of the overall state of preparedness for the presidential election.

He said the appointments of constituency and polling station agents are also at an advanced stage.

As the chief agent, Orengo will be the contact person between the IEBC and NASA candidate Raila Odinga in the run-up to the polls and on Election Day.

Orengo, a senior counsel, will be tasked with the responsibility of monitoring the declaration of presidential results at the national tallying centre at the Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi.


Raila and the NASA team will be required to raise any issues they have through the Siaya legislator.

At the 2013 polls, the announcement and declaration of presidential results were riddled with drama. At one point, security officers threw out Cord chief agents before the presidential results were declared. The officers then surrounded the IEBC commissioners, as the results were announced.

Having lawyers as NASA chief agents is seen as a strategy to boost vigilance.

Agents will be required to scrutinise presidential results declaration forms and make sure the tallies are the same as those announced at the constituencies before appending their signatures.

“The coalition is ready for the August 8 election, which NASA expects to win by a large margin. It will be futile for Jubilee to try and rig the process,” Ager said.

“I urge all NASA polling agents, constituency polling agents and supporters in general to be prepared to turn out with one accord on 8 August.

“Vote in force, meticulously protect the vote and deliver a resounding victory in order to deliver Kenya from the stifling misrule of Jubilee.”ikh Union must stay focused in tomorrow’s Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA) Super League against Swamibapa if they are to retain their top spot.

Skipper Gurdeep Singh, who has been impressive with the bat, said they will need to keep on working hard to remain competitive despite having three matches in hand.

“It feels good to be at the top but I think there are plenty of things to work on and hopefully, we can put them right starting with Swamibapa’s match on Sunday,” Gurdeep said.

With all top three contenders—Swamibapa, Stray Lions and Kanbis—also having a good run, Sikh Union are hanging on the lead by virtue of having earned more batting points in their last three matches.

“Our batting has helped us to win all the matches. We are hopeful that we will put on the same show against Swamibapa who are an equally strong team,” added Gurdeep. He said is good to see the top four teams only separated by three points and the fifth to seventh team separated by only a point in the middle of the table.


“It is good for the league cricket that the games are becoming more competitive. You’ve seen how every team has progressed in the last couple of matches,” he said.

Defending champions Stray Lions and former champions Kanbis will also be hoping to extend their winning run when they host Ruaraka and Nairobi Gymkhana respectively. The two sides are enjoying good run and if the performance of their opponents in their last three matches is anything go by, then they have a better chance of maintain their 100 percent record. In only three innings, Kanbis have scored over 1000 runs with six centuries having been scored in two innings.

With this kind of form, Gymkhana’s bowlers will be hoping to take all chances that come their way.

“We will have to work harder. We can’t afford to slip up. We don’t want to start cursing and regretting after the last bowl. We will need to be at our best in the whole match,” Nairobi Gymkhana opening bowler Lucas Oluoch said.Ruaraka are still win-less and will need to up their game if they are to stop Stray Lions.

League debutants Obuya Academy, who shocked Cutchi Leva last Sunday to register their maiden NPCA Super League win, hope to make it two wins out of two as they take on Kongonis at Nairobi Club. Sir Ali will be back at home to welcome Cutchi Leva who are also searching for their first win.As fellow Republicans labored to repeal Obamacare this week, U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly swerved off-topic, escalating concerns in his party about his ability to govern the country six months after taking office.

While senators grappled with healthcare, Trump banned transgender people from the military. He regaled a Boy Scout jamboree with a tale from a New York cocktail party. He indulged an obscene tirade by his flamboyant new communications director.

In the end, the Senate's efforts collapsed in a predawn vote on Friday, magnifying the ineffectiveness that often goes with the chaos around Trump, the constant storm of tweets, the White House infighting, the self-inflicted wounds.

"We're seeing clear evidence that all of these distractions are standing in the way of their ability to achieve legislative accomplishments," said Republican strategist Alice Stewart, a top aide to Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign last year.

In the latest twist, Trump late on Friday named U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly as his new White House chief of staff, replacing Reince Priebus, who has been in a feud with Trump's new communications director Anthony Scaramucci.

Among some establishment Republicans, there were signs that patience with Trump was wearing thin.


His national security team, seen as a bedrock of normality, increasingly is frustrated. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were described by sources as unhappy with their handling by the White House.

Defense Secretary James Mattis was coming to grips with Trump's abrupt decision on Wednesday, via a tweet, to ban transgender individuals from military service. The Pentagon said it would not execute the order without more guidance.

Republican strategist Charlie Black said Trump needs to let an investigation of possible ties between Russia and his 2016 campaign run its course and not keep talking about it. Russia denies meddling, and Trump denies any collusion.

The Russia probe has fed public spats with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, quarreling among aides and attacks on Robert Mueller, the special counsel running the investigation.

"He should be talking about policy and sticking to issues for a while," Black said. "There are still some good things that could get done in Congress like tax reform. He can help further those things if that's what he talks about."

U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Saturday to end government payments to health insurers if Congress does not pass a new healthcare bill and goaded them to not abandon their seven-year quest to replace the Obamacare law.

In a Twitter message on Saturday, Trump said "if a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly, BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!"

The tweet came a day after Senate Republicans failed to muster enough votes to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature healthcare bill commonly known as Obamacare.

The first part of Trump's tweet appeared to be referring to the approximately $8 billion in cost-sharing reduction subsidies the federal government pays to insurers to lower the price of health coverage for low-income Americans.

The second part of the tweet appeared to be a threat to end the employer contribution for members of Congress and their staffs, who were moved from the normal federal employee healthcare benefits program onto the Obamacare insurance exchanges as part of the 2010 healthcare law.

Trump later urged Senate Republicans to try again on a healthcare vote. The Senate is in session for another week before it is scheduled to begin an August recess.


"Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters, Repeal & Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill!" Trump said in a subsequent tweet.

Many insurers have been waiting for an answer from Trump or lawmakers on whether they will continue to fund the annual government subsidies. Without assurances, many insurers plan to raise rates an additional 20 percent by an Aug. 16 deadline for premium prices.

With Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare in disarray, hundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets.

In response, Trump on Friday again suggested that his administration would let the Obamacare program “implode.” He has weakened enforcement of the law’s requirement for individuals to buy insurance, threatened to cut off funding and sought to change plan benefits through regulations.

Meanwhile, some congressional Republicans were still trying to find a way forward on healthcare.President Uhuru Kenyatta has once again postponed the opening of the unfinished Sh700 million Othaya Level 4 Hospital.

The opening has been postponed five times and at one point the hospital was considered a white elephant project.

The 350-bed hospital is still under construction, which has taken more than seven years.

The problem has been blamed on delayed payments to contractors, change of contractors because of shoddy work and lengthy tendering processes.

The hospital was to be opened in January 2013 by President Mwai Kibaki. It was not completed.

In November last year, the government injected Sh300 million more to complete it.

This came after Uhuru and DP William Ruto toured the facility and promised that it would be completed by May this year and opened.

In March, then-Health PS Nicholas Muraguri toured the Othaya town facility and said it would be opened by end of May. It didn’t happen.

Its construction started in 2010 — with a Sh400 million budget.

Almost every top official of the Health ministry and members of the parliamentary Health committees have visited the hospital, promising it would be finished soon.

Residents’ patience is almost exhausted.


When Uhuru returned to Othaya on Tuesday, he told residents the facility will be complete in two months.

He promised to open it soon after, saying he will be accompanied by Kibaki.

Uhuru urged residents to take advantage of the hospital to improve their lives.

It will serve Nyeri and neighbouring counties, including Murang’a and Kirinyaga.

Some residents said the delayed opening of the hospital was one reason Othaya MP Mary Wambui lost in the Jubilee Party nominations.

They say the legislator failed to ensure the construction ended during her first term in office, despite promises.

Gichuki Mugambi, who won in the Jubilee nominations, told residents the hospital will be named after Kibaki, who served as their MP until he retired in 2013.

It will now be Mwai Kibaki Hospital. Kibaki initiated its construction.

The hospital will have more than 800 staff and a branch of Kenya Medical Training Institute.

An extension is also expected to be done for building a mortuary.Sh 700 million Othaya Level IV Hospital which has been built for over seven years is yet to be officially opened by services.

African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki was in the country last week and urged presidential candidates to ensure peace before and after the August 8 general election. He met NASA candidate Raila Odinga on Thursday and later President Uhuru Kenyatta. What, however, came out from that meeting is counteraccusations that remind me of my childhood where my brother, my only sibling, and I couldn’t own up to a mistake. Instead, we would accuse each other every time our mother demanded answers.

So in the case of the two brothers from Kenya’s political dynasties, it was reported that when Raila met Faki, he accused him of using state resources and machine to campaign. They also alleged a pattern of “militarisation” of electoral process that could trigger violence.

When Faki later met the President, he reported that Raila and the opposition were determined to ensure the country didn’t have an election on August 8.

“The upcoming polls are a key step towards a stronger democracy and resilient institutions in Kenya and of vital importance for Africa. I trust Kenya’s leaders will demonstrate wisdom, sense of responsibility that the current circumstances so compellingly call for,” Faki said after meeting the President.


The AUC chairman, together with AU election observers led by former South African President Thabo Mbeki, had earlier called on Kenya’s electoral commission to ensure that there is clarity in the electoral process to remove any suspicion of rigging.

With these statements, it appears the best the frican Union can do is urge. And basically, that is the extent of their mandate as far as the Constitutive Act is concerned. And this leads to the question, does the African Union have the capacity to ensure free and fair elections and respect for democracy in the continent? Remember this is one of its objectives. And the Star’s editorial on Monday asked, “What becomes of polls observation reports? Looking at the recent elections in Africa, there is no doubt that many of them made mockery of democracy.

In Burundi President Pierre Nkurunziza won a disputed third term in office after an election marred by violence and a boycott by the opposition in July 2015. Uganda held its general election on February 18 last year and according to the Electoral Commission, President Yoweri Museveni was reelected with 61 per cent of the vote to Kizza Besigye’s 35 per cent. This is an election that was marred by irregularities, and the outcome announced while Besigye was in custody. To be honest, I have not seen the AU doing much to ensure elections are respected. In The Gambia for example, it is Ecowas that took it upon itself to ensure the will of the people is respected. Where was the AU?

Lawyers representing Garissa governor Nathif Jama and six former procurement committee members want their case terminated on technicalities.

Lawyer Amunga Cohen told Garissa senior magistrate Cosmas Maundu that by the time Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission officials were investigating the case, there were no commissioners in office.

Jama yesterday appeared before a court with the six, including Rahma Dekow, Jawahir Keinan, Abdi Sahal, Safia Mohamed, Mohamed Hassan and Mohamud Mohamed. They are charged with flouting procurement procedures when leasing ambulances through Emergency Plus Medical Services.

EACC commissioners left office in April 2015, leaving the commission headless.

“At the time the case was being investigated, the commission was not properly constituted. It is the commissioner who recommend to the DPP that a case proceeds,” Cohen said.

The prosecution asked the court to adjourn, which Cohen objected to. He said the prosecution sought postponement last time and there was no need to push the case further.

But senior magistrate Pius Maundu adjourned to September 13.


Cohen said the prosecution did shoddy investigations and that is why they are not able to sustain the case.

State lawyer Omondi Opondo argued the office of the DPP requested to adjourn following an appeal ruling terminating anti-graft case against former Roads CS Michael Kamau.

The DPP wants to consider the position that the court of appeal took in Kamau’s matter.

In the case, the court ruled that the EACC had no authority to carry out investigations in the absence of EACC commissioners.

Addressing journalists after the court session, Jama asked hundreds of his supporters who had accompanied him to remain calm.

“Very soon our innocence on this matter will be brought to the fore,” Jama said.

He said he is confident he will be vindicated of any wrongdoing.

Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga wants police to swiftly investigate the violence at his Rarieda rally on Monday.

One person was injured and several vehicles damaged at Asembo by youths believed to be supporters of the county chief’s rival Nicholas Gumbo.

Goons attacked a vehicle belonging to former Standard editor David Ohito, who accompanied Rasanga. The rear window was smashed.

The attacks come barely a month after NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga cut short his speech in the same area when Rasanga and Gumbo’s supporters clashed.

Reacting to the two incidents in Rarieda on Wednesday, Rasanga expressed concern that police have been hesitant to bring culprits to book, “yet they are well known”.

“I urge the police to arrest and prosecute those who hurled stones during the Raila rally and at my team in Rarieda in two incidents.

“Voters have to be safe on August 8,” he said. Rasanga said he has evidence against nominated MCA Teresa Osore — Gumbo’s chief campaigner — whom he accused of giving youths Sh300 each to disrupt ODM rallies in Rarieda.

He told police to “tame such dirty acts” to ensure a peaceful environment for polls.

Gumbo dismissed the claims that his team is involved in violence.

He also urged police to investigate.

Rasanga linked the Rarieda incident to the attack on his political adviser Ochieng’ Mawere, whose car was set ablaze at his home.

He said the arsonists wanted to kill Mawere.

“Gumbo’s goons have now become too much, but I want to warn them that their days are numbered,” Rasanga said.

He told Gumbo to allow healthy competition in Siaya, instead of using violence as a campaign tool.

“Let’s compete through ideas, not dirty politics that can plunge the county into chaos,” Rasanga said.

Senator James Orengo warned Gumbo to rein in his supporters “or they will face our wrath”.Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero and Senator Mike Sonko are still neck-and-neck in the latest polls for county boss, nine days to the General Election.

A poll released on Friday by Infotrak suggests Kidero and Sonko are tied at 45 per cent.

Independent candidate Peter Kenneth has 3.3 per cent backing.

Outspoken candidate Miguna Miguna has two per cent, while Waweru Godfrey and Mumo Michael are trailing at 0.1 per cent.

The poll further indicates that four per cent of the respondents interviewed say they are undecided.

Research consultant Mary Njoki said the one-on-one survey covered 1,500 registered voters between July 15-22. The survey has a +/- 2.5 per cent margin of error with a 95 per cent level of confidence.

Sakaja leads in senator race

In the senator race, 50 per cent of the respondents said they would vote for Johnson Sakaja (Jubilee).

Sakaja is followed by ODM’s Edwin Sifuna at 28 per cent and Suzanne Silantoi at 1.5 per cent.

Twenty per cent of Nairobians are undecided on senator.

For woman representative, the poll found NASA’s Esther Passaris is leading with 61 per cent followed by incumbent Rachel Shebesh at 28 per cent.


Rosemary Wairimu is third at 0.5 per cent, followed by Theuri Khadija and Winnie Wainaina at 0.3 per cent.

Rahab Ndambuki and Omolo Teresia follow at 0.2 per cent, and Nadya Khan trails with 0.1 per cent.

According to the survey, NASA enjoys a 54 per cent popularity vote compared to Jubilee’s 38 per cent. Four per cent of respondents said they do not support any party.

“This indicates that if elections were held today, NASA’s Raila Odinga would get 56 per cent of Nairobi votes, while Jubilee’s Uhuru Kenyatta would come second with 40 per cent of the votes,” Njoki said.

She said ARC’s Mohammed Dida is third with 0.5 per cent, and Michael Wainaina and Ekuru Aukot trail with 0.1 per cent.

Some 2.8 per cent of the respondents said they were undecided.

Five subcounties are swing votes

The polls shows that NASA enjoys strong support from seven subcounties of Westlands, Dagoretti North, Kibera, Embakasi South, Embakasi Central, Embakasi East and Makadara.

Jubilee on the other side enjoys support from five subcounties of Dagoretti South, Roysambu, Embakasi West, Kamukunji ad Starehe.

Meanwhile, the poll marks Lang’ata, Ruaraka, Kasarani, Embakasi North and Mathare subcounties as swing-vote areas.

This is not a predictive poll and things are likely to change as we near D-day, Njoki said.Independent Homa Bay governor hopeful Medo Misama's candidature for the top county seat suffered a setback on Friday after his deputy Mark Amala decamped to incumbent governor Cyprian Awiti's side.

Governor Awiti is defending the seat on an ODM ticket.

Speaking during a political meeting in Kochia, Rangwe constituency, Amala said he did not want to associate himself with a group of people who fight the ODM party in the county.

He argued that Misama's candidature for the seat was not at the interest of the county but to weaken the ODM candidate.

The meeting was organised by Awiti and Homa Bay county woman rep Gladys Wanga.

"I'm no longer ready to be with those who fight and wreck ODM and its leadership in this area. I also don't want to oppose NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga," Amala said.

He accused Misama of undermining him in their campaigns.

"He's always dismissive wherever I ask him (about) those who bankroll him," he added.

However, Misama said Amala has been bought for Sh5 million adding that he is not shaken.

He said his running mate has betrayed their supporters in the county and he should be ready to carry the cross alone.

"It's unfortunate we can get such kind of leaders within us in this century. History will judge him harshly because he has bowed to the pressure for money," Misama told the Star on phone on Saturday.

Misama claimed Awiti targeted him due to his rising popularity in the race.

"Despite my running mate doing minimal in selling our agendas,I have popularized my candidature hence the reason why they had to buy my deputy," he said.


The governor hopeful vowed to give Awiti and his ODM team a run for their money.

"I still hope Homa Bay residents would vote their leaders on the basis of development agenda and not those who have failed the county," he said.

During the rally, Awiti welcomed Amala saying he has seen sense.

"It's always good to follow what your sense tells you than your human desires," Awiti said.

The latest development comes barely hours after Nairobi governor seat aspirant Miguna Miguna's running mate Karen Wangenye withdrew from the race.

A lawyer who represented victims in one of the Kenya cases at the ICC told the Kenyan High Court that individuals wanted by the court for alleged bribery cannot demand to see the evidence against them before they have been charged.

Wilfred Nderitu told the court on Wednesday that Paul Gicheru and Philip Bett, against whom the ICC has issued arrest warrants, cannot claim the fair trial rights in Kenya’s constitution because neither of them is an accused person.

“My submission is that that is not applicable at all. (Article) 50 (2) (of Kenya’s constitution) relates to the rights of an accused person. Neither the first respondent (Paul Gicheru) nor the second respondent (Philip Bett) is an accused person,” Nderitu said.

A little later, Nderitu elaborated his point.

“As they (Gicheru and Bett) are here in court they are here as suspects, not as accused persons,” he told the court.

“This is not a trial. If it was a trial then there would be witnesses that would be called in the normal way to come and give evidence,” Nderitu said, referring to the fact that the court was only hearing submissions from lawyers.

Nderitu further argued that giving evidence to a wanted individual before they are arrested would give them an opportunity to flee.

“It would be total anarchy,” he said.

Nderitu made the submissions on Wednesday as an interested party in his capacity as the lawyer who represented victims in the now terminated trial of Deputy President William Samoei Ruto and former journalist Joshua arap Sang.

Judge Luka Kimaru has to review two applications. One is the application the Director of Public Prosecutions has made to execute the ICC arrest warrant for Gicheru and Bett. Lawyers for Gicheru and Bett have filed their own applications asking the court to quash the ICC arrest warrant.

Gicheru and Bett are wanted by the ICC on allegations they bribed or attempted to bribe six prosecution witnesses, offering between 500,000 shillings (about US $4,800 at current exchange rates) and five million shillings (about US $48,000) to each to withdraw as witnesses. These bribery allegations are offenses under Article 70 of the ICC’s founding law, the Rome Statute.

The ICC issued, under seal, the arrest warrant against them on March 10, 2015. The court lifted the seal on September 10, 2015 when the ICC prosecutor informed the court that Gicheru and Bett were arrested by Kenyan police on July 30, 2015.

Some of the pseudonyms of the witnesses given in the arrest warrant for Gicheru and Bett correspond with those witnesses who testified during the trial of Ruto and Sang, which was terminated in April 2016.

On Wednesday, Nderitu listed several provisions in Kenya’s International Crimes Act that set out the procedure to be followed when the government receives a request for cooperation from the ICC. Nderitu specifically listed sections 19, 35 and 39 and argued those provisions had been complied with.

Nderitu then argued that the lawyers for Gicheru and Bett needed to show that these provisions did not provide their clients with safeguards.

“It is my submission that that has not been shown at all,” Nderitu said.

The International Crimes Act is based on the Rome Statute and was legislated after Kenya became a member of the ICC.

Read: Senior ICC prosecutor says Kenya unwilling to prosecute Gicheru, Bett

PROVISIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION


Later, Nderitu argued there are constitutional provisions that protect individuals against discrimination and guarantee their equality. He listed these provisions as Articles 27, 28 and 29 of the constitution.

“It is my submission that the respondents have not demonstrated how these provisions have been violated in relation to them,” Nderitu said.

One issue that Judge Kimaru and Nderitu spent some time discussing was the role of the High Court of Kenya when it is presented with a request for arrest and surrender from the ICC.

Nderitu submitted that the High Court had the power to determine whether individuals wanted by the ICC should be surrendered to that court. However, the High Court cannot determine whether there was a credible basis for an ICC arrest warrant.

“So, the warrant is a fait accompli?” asked Judge Kimaru.

“The warrant is fait accompli,” replied Nderitu. “But the court can inquire into the surrender.”

Judge Kimaru then asked Nderitu to explain how the High Court of Kenya related with the ICC. The judge asked whether the ICC was a court of concurrent jurisdiction or whether it had complementary jurisdiction or whether it was superior to the High Court of Kenya. Nderitu said the ICC was a court of concurrent jurisdiction but it has had a complementary jurisdiction.

Nderitu also told the court that the March 10, 2015 decision of the Single Judge of the ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber II to issue an arrest warrant for Gicheru and Bett should be presumed to have been made in good faith.

Nderitu elaborated that when the Single Judge made the decision that it was appropriate for the ICC to exercise its jurisdiction in the case of Gicheru and Bett, “then it is to be presumed that all due diligence in the process of determining the appropriateness was under taken.”

Before Nderitu made his submissions on Wednesday, Judge Kimaru allowed Kibe Mungai, a lawyer representing Gicheru to present further arguments. Mungai had previously made submissions in this case more than two weeks ago.

Mungai told the court that in early 2015 his client was summoned to the Kilimani police station in Nairobi and asked to record a statement “in relation to alleged interference with ICC witnesses.” Mungai said that since then the police have not communicated with Gicheru.

“Therefore, we presume the investigation did not disclose any wrongdoing on the part of Gicheru,” said Mungai.

He also told the court that the Attorney General (AG) should not have been allowed to make submissions as an amicus curiae, or friend of the court.

Mungai said the Attorney General “had authorised the execution of the ICC request,” as detailed in a May 14, 2015 letter of then Cabinet Secretary for Internal Security Joseph Nkaissery to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

“As the AG had played a vital role of initiating the proceedings before you, his position as amicus in this matter is heavily compromised because it was on his advice that these proceedings commenced,” Mungai said.

Mungai also submitted that there is evidence of “very serious wrongdoing on the part of officials of the ICC,” that needed to be addressed and related to the arrest warrant for his client. Mungai did not give any details of the alleged wrongdoing but he said the allegations were in an affidavit submitted to the High Court.

“It is our submission that there is good evidence of oppression and prejudice,” Mungai said.

Once Mungai and Nderitu completed their submissions, Judge Kimaru said the hearing would continue onThursday.Rongai MP Raymond Moi (KANU) is facing stiff competition from Jubilees’ Andrew Komen who has been campaigning aggressively for the August 8 election.

Komen, a close ally of Deputy President William Ruto, has for the last three weeks been marshaling support from other Jubilee nominees in a bid to woo as many voters as possible.

Komen, Kikuyu MP Kimani Icung’wa and Kericho Senator Aron Cheruiyot visited Mang’u estate, which had been seen as Raymond's stronghold, on Friday evening.

They pushed for the six-piece voting style and accused the incumbent of contributing little in the national assembly.

Ichung'wa earlier asked voters to replace Raymond for "sleeping on the job".

The legislator, who will be unopposed in the August 8 polls, said the politician does not deserve re-election.

"Don't give this guy any more chances. He has been sleeping in Parliament instead of representing you," he told residents on Tuesday.

Icung’wa, who was on his second visit, said it would be useless for President Uhuru Kenyatta to have fewer supporter sin the National Assembly.

Icung’wa and Cheruiyot hit at the Opposition for claiming the government is planning to use the military to rig the election.

“During the electioneering period, the country is at the highest risk of being attacked by enemies, among them terrorists, thus the need to protect it from external aggression," he said.

"I ask everyone to keep vigil and all residents of Nakuru to embrace peace."

The leaders also asked the Opposition, led by Raila Odinga, to maintain peace.Dr Julius Juan CEO Kenya Institute of curriculum development (KICD) (center) with Indimuli Kahi chairman KESSHA (left) and Teresia Mutegi chhairperson mwalimu national sacco (right) when they launch the teachers and learner law book during the 42 annual teachers conference at wild waters Mombasa, Photo/JOHN CHESOLI

Secondary school principals are urging the government to introduce a Secondary Education Levy to facilitate development programmes in schools that stalled following regulations capping school fees.

The principals are further suggesting an increase in the amount of capitation from Sh12,870 per student to Sh20,000 to facilitate academics and infrastructure development.

Through their association, the principals argue that the high cost of living and high inflation have led to a slowdown in the education sector, forcing schools to stop some projects.

Schools are being forced to hire more BOM teachers to address the worsening Curriculum Based Establishment. It is becoming practically impossible to run schools with the gazetted fees and meagre grants allocated by the government.

Speaking to the Star on Friday, Kenya Secondary School Heads Association national chairman Kahi Indimuli said the principals are overburdened by obligations largely because of non-flexible fees guidelines as heads of institutions cannot charge extra levies.

This follows fees guidelines imposed by the Ministry of Education in January 2016 to regulate the maximum amount, after a probe by the ministry established some schools were overcharging parents.


Indimuli said the guidelines have caused nightmares to Boards of Management and disrupted operations.

“Most institutions acquired loans from commercial banks to put up new infrastructure or refurbish the existing ones. These loans need to be serviced. With no extra levies, it becomes practically impossible to successfully manage these schools — the reason we call on the Ministry of Education to review its policies, some of which are in conflict with the Education Act,” he said.

However, the Education ministry has said the move was aimed at saving parents from the high cost of education.

Indimuli urged the ministry to set up a mechanism to establish schools’ needs before providing fees guidelines.

“To strengthen the quality of teaching and learning, and in order to make schools effective and attractive, the government has no otherwise, but to employ more teachers, be flexible on fees guidelines, and, more so, increase the current financing provisions,” he said.

Among projects cited to have been stalled include renovation of existing infrastructure, setting up new structures, recruiting more teachers, hiring of non-teaching staff, and equipping laboratories and workshops.The furore over Sh200 billion Amu coal-fired power plant complex is blamed partly on the decision to import coal from South Africa, and not Kitui, it has emerged.

A Wiper official is said to have lost the contract to supply coal from Kitui.

The Kitui coal has a high sulfur content and is highly polluting. Coal will be imported from South Africa for at least 10 years until the Kitui supply is established.

On Wednesday Mombasa governor candidates Hassan Omar (Wiper) and Suleiman Shahbal (Jubilee) differed sharply over the plant’s existence, as it became evident that a Wiper official had bid to supply coal from Kitui to the proposed plant.

The politician is accused of being behind the party’s vigorous efforts to stop the project. This came to light when Omar and Shahbal clashed during the Mombasa governor aspirants debate organised by the Kenya Alliance of Residents’ Association.

Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho (ODM) and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti (VDP) did not attend.

Shahbal said, “He [a Wiper official] wanted to supply coal from Kitui. He saw it as an opportunity for Kitui coal to be used there.”

The official was not identified.

Omar termed the claims “mere allegations”. “It is absolutely true in what sense?” he asked.

Wednesday’s allegation about a lost business contract appeared to shed light on the controversy

An investment agreement has been signed, however, construction is in limbo, as there is a stay order from court.

Environmentalists have said the plant will pollute air, water and land and cause many health problems.

Resistance is enormous.

The world is turning to renewable energy, even China is closing coal plants.

Nasa against plant, jubilee backs it

NASA says the coal project will be cancelled if it takes over government, saying only clean coal technology will be used.


Wiper is an affiliate of NASA.

Clean coal technology removes air pollutants before emission.

Jubilee is fully behind the AMU coal plant, which it calls a pillar of achievements of its first term.

Only clearance of the site has been done after the December 2015 launch.

Omar said Wiper boss Kalonzo Musyoka and NASA oppose the plant over real health and environmental risks.

Omar and Shahbal argued. Shahbal trashed health and environmental risks, saying experts were not wholly reliable.

He said every undertaking has risks and the benefits of the coal project outweigh its negative impacts, he said.

Cheaper electricity

Shahbal said Kenya is not industrialised because of the high cost of power.

“That coal plant will bring down price of power to a third, to mean that hundreds of industries will be established and jobs will be created,” he said.

The project aims to inject 5,000MW of power to the national grid.

Shahbal said the environmental concerns raised are the control of sulphur, nitrate and water, which will be handled based on World Bank standards.

“Noise pollution will be controlled based on the WB standards. Those displaced will be resettled,” he said.

Controversy still surrounds compensation of the displaced residents.

Omar said the whole world is going green and companies are shutting down coal plants because of the risks."Each of the colonies on the agar represented a single bacteria cell from the frosting." /DAILY MAIL

For those who will jump for a slice of birthday cake, you might want to think twice.

New data show that the ritual of blowing out the candles leaves the dessert ridden with bacteria.

A team of researchers at Clemson University in South Carolina found that the saliva spread from blowing out birthday candles increases bacteria in the icing by 1,400 percent.

Dr Paul Dawson, a professor at the university, conducted the study with a group of his undergraduate students to get them thinking about food safety.

He normally looks into things like the five-second rule or the risk of sharing food, but said he got the idea for this study from his own experience as a father.

"I got the idea actually from my daughter in a casual dinner conversation when I was explaining the project to her," he told Daily Mail Online.

The research team put frosting on a piece of foil atop a cake-shaped Styrofoam wheel, which they stuck candles in.

Before blowing out the candles, they all ate pizza, to "simulate a birthday party" and "help the salivary glands get going".

They then lit the candles and blew them out.

To count bacteria, the team diluted the frosting with sterilised water and then spread it out on agar plates for the bacteria to grow.

Each of the colonies on the agar represented a single bacteria cell from the frosting.


Dr Dawson noted that this isn't the most precise way to count bacteria, because not each one will grow on an agar plate. There are now more expensive and precise ways to count bacteria cells, but this is a classic baseline method.

The team of researchers found that there was a lot of bacteria, but more surprisingly, that each blow resulted in different types of bacteria.

On average, blowing out the candles caused the frosting to grow 14 times as much bacteria.

However, in one case, it was increased by more than 120 times, suggesting certain people transfer more bacteria than others.

But, Dr Dawson said this new data shouldn't ruin birthday parties.

"In my opinion, you're fine to eat a birthday cake if someone blew out the candles," he explained. "I don't think you'd get sick."

Human mouths are full of bacteria, and most of them are not harmful.

Additionally, if blowing out candles on a birthday cake actually caused the spread of deadly diseases it would be obvious because of how common the practice is, especially in children.

Dr Dawson said he might avoid the cake if he thought the candle-blower looked sick, but otherwise thought it was probably fine.

This is not the first time he's done studies like this.

In 2015, he shared a controversial article for anyone who likes to double dip their chips, saying that doing it is not only socially unacceptable, but could risk the spread of infectious diseases.Wizkid's "Sounds From the Other Side" album cover art

Album: Sounds From The Other Side

Artist: Wizkid

Genre: Hip hop, Rap, Afro pop

Release: July 13

Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, better known as Wizkid, knows his origin story. Since his breakthrough hit "Holla at Your Boy," the Nigerian-born singer stayed committed to his come-up narrative and doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. He is breaking barriers and taking over the game.

He threw a good number of hits and captured the attention of the international scene through his globally recognised track "Ojuelegba". Now he has worked with the likes of Tinie Tempah, Chris Brown and Drake and tops some of the major charts in the world.


On Sounds From the Other Side, the 27-year-old singer is much of a globalist. He has been able to move around genres with relative ease. He has a clearer idea of his strengths and exhibits this quality and plenty more on his 40-minute long album.

The effort is a basically the singers most grounded and focused work yet. With help from American rapper Drake, Wizkid offers an inarguably fun-filled vibe on "Come Closer". Major Lazer and Chris Brown provide the much-needed star power on tracks "Naughty Ride" and "African Bad Gyal" respectively.

The December 2016 hit "Daddy Yo" is one of the tracks that made it on the project. He borrows Ty Dolla $ign's vocals twice on "One For Me" and "Dirty Wine". He stays true to his roots with South African R&B and house singer Bucie in the romantic track "All For Love". The album closes with the club-destined "Gbese", which features American Trey Songz.

Wizkid continues to deliver hit after hit, not caring much about the depth of his content, but about staying relevant. His contribution in ensuring that the African sound is accepted globally has been tremendous.

There's no doubt that the album might receive both positive and negative criticism, but Wizkid's maturation is noticeable across the album's 12 tracks. From the reaction around the world, he has made a catchy pop album.

Star rating: 3.5 out of 5.August 8 is a do-or-die election and you’ll have yourselves to blame if you don’t turn up in large numbers to vote, the UhuRuto Express has told supporters.

“We are passionately imploring you to rise up early and vote, man to man, on voting day,” Othaya MP Mary Wambui said on Thursday.

“[This will give] our development-conscious President and his deputy a decisive victory that cannot be subjected to court disputes and processes as has become common with our competitors.” Wambui spoke on behalf of the team at Ciakariga Market, Tharaka Nithi county.

The team is made up of 15 MPs who lost during the Jubilee Party nominations and came together to campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta’s reelection.

JP, NASA hunting ground

Wambui criticised the Raila Odinga-led opposition for its “obsession” with lawsuits “even on matters that add little value to their campaigns”.


“They have perfected this art, simply for political expediency and for purposes of derailing the election,” she said.

“This time round, they have gone to court on matters of the roles of defence forces, forgetting the fact that the prime role of our security forces, be they the army, police or any other security agents, is to safeguard peace and harmony for the Kenyan citizens.”

Tharaka Nithi, considered a swing vote, has at least 500,000 voters and has tilted elections in the past.

Both NASA and Jubilee have made forays into the county.

Last month Raila was welcomed by residents who said they will support NASA if it promises to develop the county if it wins. Raila said he will ensure jobs for the youth.

Today, the group will be to Chuka and Chogoria before proceeding to Meru County.Creativity is a type of thinking that helps us solve problems in a new way. In the rapidly changing life and work environment, this skill is instrumental to our survival and success. It helps us transcend our limitations and advance the quality of life. Creative intelligence is the ultimate intelligence, but it cannot exist without emotions. Being creative is not only about thinking, it is also about feeling.

Emotions are evaluations. When we feel emotions about something — joy, anger, boredom, pain, etc. — we express our relationship with it. “It is astonishing how little many people know about their feelings. Their life passes by as a stream of featureless experience and events," says Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his ‘creativity' book. "Contrary to this state of apathy, creative individuals are in a close touch with their emotions.”

Recent neuroscience studies show that creative people have greater connections between the areas of their brain associated with control and imagination. In other words, creative people are characterised by rationality as well emotionality. The studies also show that people who experience intense emotions on a regular basis scored higher on measures of creative capacity. Openness to emotions is a good predictor of creativity. "There's something about living life with passion and intensity that is conducive to creativity," says phycologists M Ceci and V Kumar of University of Pennsylvania. Furthermore, the ability to experience the mixed emotions, such as excitement and frustration, for example, in unusual environments (like aeroplanes and bicycles suspended from the ceiling at IDEO) signals increased creativity.

The division between emotions and thinking was given an undeserved prominence by the 18th and 19th centuries' Enlightenment intellectuals, who saw intellect and feelings as separate realms of experience. They considered feelings a ‘dangerous froth of undisciplined mind'. Formal academic education promoted logic and deduction ability and marginalised feelings. This division is present to this day and has been catastrophic to education.

In the 1920s, this view was opposed by a belief that education should be child-centred rather than knowledge-based. Developing feelings, the knowledge of self, was considered to be more important than knowledge of the world. This was another ‘extreme' that reinforced the division between the rational mind and emotions.


Educating emotions does not mean less of academic education. Intelligence plays a key role in our emotions. Likewise, intelligence does not mean suppressing feelings. Feelings enable intelligence. They work hand-in-hand with the rational mind and guide more than 85 per cent of all our decisions.

Thinking and emotionality are intertwined. The link is not an ‘opinion'. It is a biology. The part of the brain responsible for feelings, amygdala, is at the centre of the brain's neural circuitry. When something emotional activates the amygdala, it activates other parts of the brain.

The thinking-feeling relationship is at the heart of the creative process in all fields, art, science, technology, and business. If you wish to be creative and thus successful, your emotions and thinking should be in sync. Learn about your emotions: assess how you spend your time and how you feel about your various activities. And, critically important, find a way of expressing what moves you in words, ideas, images or music.

Alla Tkachuk, is a creativity specialist, founder of MASK creativity-training movement. If you need advice how to strengthen creativity at your school, university, or company, Jubilee Party wants a wider bench to hear a suit that seeks to force the IEBC to open the voters’ register for public scrutiny.

The electoral agency, however, told a court on Friday the case lodged by activist Gladwell Otieno has no merit and is bad in law, and should therefore be struck out.

Otieno, who is Africog founder and executive director, claims there are inconsistencies in numbers that have been declared by the IEBC in the register.

Otieno is seeking orders to prohibit the commission from deploying the register before it is scrutinised. The case came up for directions before Justice George Odunga.


She last week told the court that despite her requests, the IEBC has declined to publish the register as required by law.

Odunga was asked by the Jubilee not to hear the case to determination, but instead forward the file to Chief Justice David Maraga for purposes of constituting a three-judge bench.

Odunga will on Monday deliver a ruling on whether the case merits to be heard by a bench or a single judge.A senior prosecutor told Kenya’s High Court the country is unwilling to prosecute two Kenyans wanted by the ICC in relation to bribery allegations against them.

Senior Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions Victor Mule told the court on Thursday that in such a situation the ICC can exercise its jurisdiction as a court of last resort. He argued this was possible because the ICC’s founding law, the Rome Statute, has force of law in Kenya.

Mule said this during submissions before Judge Luka Kimaru on an application the DPP made to execute an arrest warrant for Paul Gicheru and Philip Bett.

The ICC issued an arrest warrant for them in March 2015 alleging they have bribed or tried to bribe six prosecution witnesses so that they withdraw as witnesses in an ICC case.

On Thursday, Judge Kimaru asked Mule a series of questions on why Kenya was not prosecuting Gicheru and Bett and instead applying to execute the ICC warrant for the two.

“Neither the Attorney General nor the DPP nor the Cabinet Secretary has taken up the prosecution of the respondents (Gicheru and Bett),” Mule told the court. Mule then said that in such a situation Article 17 of the Rome Statute applies.

“That if the government of Kenya is unwilling, therefore, as a court of last resort the ICC comes in,” said Mule.

Judge Kimaru asked what would happen if Kenya chose to prosecute Gicheru and Bett.

“The state is supposed to make a request to the ICC for a waiver of jurisdiction,” answered Mule, adding that this would be under Rule 162 of the ICC Rules of Procedure and Evidence.

“No such request has been made,” Mule continued.

“Why?” asked Judge Kimaru.

“Because the State is unwilling to prosecute,” Mule replied.

“So, you are telling me the state has abdicated its responsibility?” asked Judge Kimaru.

“It is not that the state has abdicated its responsibility. It has not made a decision (to prosecute),” answered Mule.

“So, you are throwing them under the bus?” asked Judge Kimaru.

“I’ll not take it that way. This is a case where we cannot have the two proceedings in both the ICC and the national jurisdiction,” answered Mule.

US, EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DO NOT SUBMIT EASILY

Judge Kimaru then commented that the United States and European countries do not easily submit to international proceedings.

“They jealously guard their national jurisdiction. They do not surrender to international jurisdiction. But here is a case whereby the DPP is very willing to surrender national jurisdiction,” said Judge Kimaru. “I would find that situation extremely alarming.”

“What we have is an election. An election this case will not be investigated and prosecuted (in the national jurisdiction). An election has been done,” responded Mule.


In the arrest warrant the ICC issued against Gicheru and Bett, they are alleged to have bribed or attempted to bribe six prosecution witnesses, offering each between 500,000 shillings (about US $4,800 at current exchange rates) and five million shillings (about US $48,000) to withdraw as witnesses. These bribery allegations are offenses under Article 70 of the Rome Statute.

The ICC issued, under seal, the arrest warrant against them on March 10, 2015. The court lifted the seal on September 10, 2015 after the ICC prosecutor informed the court that the Kenyan police arrested Gicheru and Bett on July 30, 2015.

Some of the pseudonyms of the witnesses given in the arrest warrant for Gicheru and Bett correspond with those witnesses who testified during the trial of Deputy President William Samoei Ruto and Joshua arap Sang, which was terminated in April 2016.

On Thursday, Mule submitted that the argument made by lawyers for Gicheru and Bett about the fair trial rights of their clients was wrong.

“The Rome Statute has got the most elaborate procedures in the world for ensuring fair trial,” Mule said.

He then listed where the Rome Statute provides for fair trial rights. Mule went on to list other documents of the ICC, such as, the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of Crimes and the Rules of the Court to further his point that the ICC has elaborate provisions for fair trial rights.

Mule said their rights were also safeguarded when Gicheru and Bett were summoned by the Kenyan police and brought to court.

“The court granted them bail as of right. We have never contested the terms and there has never been objection (to the bail),” Mule told the court. He did not state when Gicheru and Bett were summoned or granted bail.

QUALITY OF ARREST WARRANT

Lillian Obwo, also from the Office of the DPP, made submissions on an arrest warrant issued by High Court Judge Jessie Lesiit when the judge was presented with the ICC’s request for the arrest of Gicheru and Bett. Lawyers for the two have applied to Kimaru to quash that warrant.

“In terms of the quality of the warrant of arrest that was given by Justice Lesiit, we are submitting that, my Lord, Justice Lesiit exercised her jurisdiction and that jurisdiction cannot be interfered with by this court,” said Obwo.

She then added that Judges Lesiit and Kimaru are both High Court judges and the lawyers for Gicheru and Bett can appeal the warrant at the Court of Appeal.

She did not give details of when the arrest order issued by Judge Lesiit was issued. It is possible that is the order that led to the arrest of Gicheru and Bett on July 30, 2015 that the ICC prosecutor informed Pre-Trial Chamber II about at the time.

Obwo said what was left for Judge Kimaru to do was, “look at the eligibility of surrender and look at whether the applicants have breached the respondents’ rights.”

Continuing her submissions, Obwo said she would play devil’s advocate.

“Should this court quash the warrant issued by Justice Lesiit, the warrant is still in existence at the ICC. If I were the respondents, I would be more worried by the existence of the warrant of the ICC because that warrant is still in existence,” said Obwo.

When the hearing began on Thursday, Senior State Counsel Christopher Siro responded, on behalf of the Attorney General, to a submission made by a lawyer for Gicheru that the Attorney General was biased and should be an amicus curiae in the proceedings.

Siro said Mungai had not objected when the Attorney General applied to be admitted as amicus curiae in the hearing and thus he was late in raising an objection.

“We have not taken sides. Our main aim before this court is to demonstrate the principles which the court ought to take in the determination before it,” said Siro.

After all parties concluded their submissions on Thursday, Judge Kimaru said he would make his ruling on the applications before him on September 20.

The latest presidential opinion polling results before the August 8 General Election reported by Ipsos and Infotrak placed President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA supremo Raila Odinga in a dead heat. Ipsos had Uhuru ahead at 47 per cent to Raila’s 43 per cent and Infotrak announced the former Prime Minister at 47 per cent to Uhuru’s 43 per cent.

This divergence of results underpinned by the concurrence that the President and his challenger are actually in a dead heat struck a number of analysts as questionable.

Macharia Gaitho, writing in the Daily Nation on Tuesday under the headline “Why opinion poll results are questionable”, commented, “While the Zogby survey could be dismissed because it was paid for and publicised by the NASA campaign, the Infotrak one should attract attention as the first poll in the run-upto [the election] to place Mr Odinga ahead of President Kenyatta.”

Gaitho patently disbelieves Infotrak chief executive officer’s Angela Ambitho’s explanation of Raila’s dramatic surge of four percentage points to overtake Uhuru. Ambitho argued, “More people have decided. NASA had more ‘undecided’ in their strongholds than Jubilee did”.

THE COUNTIES, NOT THE DEFUNCT PROVINCES, ARE WHAT COUNTS NOW

There is an inescapable factor that has been brought to the fore by the divergence between Ipsos and Infotrak: Any opinion polling of Kenyans on the question of the race for State House needs to be done according to the counties, not the now-defunct provincial boundaries. And it must poll individuals indigenous to particular counties, not, for instance, a Kikuyu who resides in Bungoma or a Bukusu who resides in Nyeri.

Under devolution, pollsters need to go to the extent of asking respondents where they come from: Context is everything. There is a reason that the Kuria vote differently from the Luo despite the fact that they are both from Nyanza.

Having arrived at the conclusion that the August 8 presidential context is a two-horse race that is currently in a neck-by-neck dead heat, the pollsters will need to focus their attentions on the decisive factor of turnout, i.e. how the winner will pull ahead of the loser and establish a lead, from narrow to commanding.

An interesting factor of what happens next is, for instance, that President Uhuru would win by 52% if JP maintains its 2013 performance, an even wider margin than four-and-a-half years ago.

A careful look at the Infotrak poll shows the pollster visited the following 13 NASA-leaning counties – Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa, Taita Taveta, Kitui, Machakos, Makueni, Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Homa Bay, Kisii and Kisumu. Infotrack visited the following nine Jubilee leaning counties – Embu, Meru, Kiambu, Nyeri, Baringo, Bomet, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Murang’a.

Infotrak left out the following NASA-compliant counties – Siaya, Migori, Nyamira, Vihiga. And they left out the following Jubilee-compliant counties – West Pokot, Nandi, Laikipia, Kericho, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nyandarua, Kirinyagaand Tharaka-Nithi.

The swing states in this case are Samburu, Isiolo and Tana River, Lamu.

What does this mean? It means that Infotrak over-sampled NASA by four counties, rendering their poll biased.

STUDY THE SWING VOTES, THE STRONGHOLDS AREN’T GOING ANYWHERE

The major pollsters would do well to study the so-called swing vote blocs more than the strongholds of either side. The strongholds aren’t going anywhere, whoever the final winner. But the swing vote blocs are in ferment and contain the bulk of the undecided.

The Jubilee strongholds are Baringo, Bomet, Elgeyo Marakwet, Embu, Kericho, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Laikipia, Meru, Murang’a, Nakuru, Nandi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Tharaka-Nithi, Uasin Gishu and West Pokot. Based on the IEBC’s latest register, there are 7.41 million voters in these counties.

The NASA strongholds are Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Kilifi, Kisumu, Kitui, Kwale, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Migori, Mombasa, Siaya, Taita Taveta, Tana River and Vihiga counties. Based on the IEBC’s latest updated figures, these counties have 7.02 million registered voters.

The following are the battleground counties: Nairobi, Kajiado, Narok, Kisii, Nyamira, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, Samburu and Trans Nzoia. According to the IEBC, they have 5.1 million registered voters.


SHIFTS AND UNDERLYING TENSIONS

The local dynamics in every county have dramatically changed over the past four-and-a-half years. The main reasons for these shifts are the changing demographics of the voting population, who are younger, more youthful, more open-minded and more development-conscious than ever before.

Accurate mapping is now done by the counties, not by the old provinces. The latter no longer exist in the era of devolution and the Constitution of Kenya 2010. The new regions are the counties. To reiterate, the key thing to grasp and proceed from is that the electoral map has changed dramatically since the 11th General Election of March 2013. The new regions are the counties.

Trends since 2013 show that Jubilee and NASA have an equal number of stronghold counties – 17 each. The remaining 13 counties are now considered battleground counties. These counties have received the most attention from both the Jubilee and NASA strategists and campaigners.

As at March 2017, the JP strongholds were Baringo, Bomet, Elgeyo/Marakwet, Embu, Kericho, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Laikipia, Meru, Murang’a, Nakuru, Nandi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Tharaka-Nithi, Uasin Gishu and West Pokot counties.

In March, the NASA strongholds were Bungoma, Busia, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kilifi, Kisumu, Kitui, Kwale, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Migori, Mombasa, Siaya, Taita Taveta, Tana River and Vihiga counties.

COUNTY DYNAMICS HAVE CHANGED

The local dynamics within each of the 47 counties have changed over the last four-and-a-half years. The demographics of the voting population have changed, becoming more youthful, more open-minded and more development-conscious.

Delivery of development projects has cut across all the counties in Kenya. This has helped the Kenyan electorate to gradually becoming more issue-focused. In addition, both Jubilee and NASA have been making inroads into each other’s perceived traditional strongholds. These forays have also changed the electoral map, resulting in a situation where the 2013 returns cannot be wholly relied upon.

These changing dynamics have resulted in the mapping of battleground or swing counties.

From where JP is standing, Kisii is on the move; the Somali communities have moved; Lamu, Tana River and Taita Taveta are already considerably with JP.

THE BATTLEGROUND COUNTIES

A key indicator of this is the enormous focus both campaigns have placed on key counties. An analysis of their campaign visits reveals that both campaign teams have focused primarily on 13 counties.

This analysis reveals that there are 13 battleground counties. Both Jubilee and NASA are hoping to ‘flip’ these counties in their favour and claim them as their own. Based on the observable trends on the ground, Jubilee has no counties at risk; NASA has 3 counties at considerable risk of flipping. After the second and final Mass Voter Registration (MVR II), a quick comparison of the respective strongholds shows that Jubilee is starting off with more than 400,000 votes ahead of NASA. These voter registration statistics reveal that Jubilee run a more effective voter mobilisation exercise than NASA. These numbers also suggest that there are higher levels of apathy in NASA strongholds than in Jubilee strongholds.

Since MVR II, Uhuru and Ruto have campaigned aggressively – running high octane, energetic serial campaign tours. The two have also delivered a very compelling, development-oriented message, backed by an impressive, credible track record.

NASA’s campaign messaging has tended to fall back on old prescriptions. It relies heavily on political rhetoric, which is divisive and unappealing – particularly to the large majority of youth who remain undecided.

NASA’s anti-election message is also increasingly being rejected on the ground, whereas Jubilee’s stand – that of protecting the election date – is viewed a lot more favourably by a large cross section of the public.

The credible, objective pollsters who will begin to show Uhuru maintain and even pull away from Raila, or vice versa, will be in a position to call the August 8 election.David Rudisha can't wait to get back to the stadium where he ran a world record time five years ago and is confident he can maintain his dominance of the 800 metres at the world championships in London next week.

The 28-year-old Kenyan still holds the two-lap world record with the one minute 40.91 seconds he ran for his first Olympic gold, when he lit up a packed East London stadium on a balmy August night in 2012.

"I am really excited to return to London," Rudisha told Reuters at Team Kenya's training camp in the capital over the weekend.

"London is a special place for me. Breaking the world record in 2012 and winning that title, remains one of the greatest moments in my career.

"I am really looking forward to returning to the same stadium, and especially this time to defend my title."

While Rudisha successfully defended his Olympic crown with a devastating last-lap sprint in Rio last year, injury prevented him from going back-to-back in 2013 after he won his first world championship gold at Daegu in 2011.

Victory in a tactical race in Beijing won him back the world title in 2015, however, and he returns to London looking to secure his legacy by matching the great Wilson Kipketer as a three-times champion.


"Being world champions makes us the people to beat. We are feeling that pressure, yes, but we are ready to soak it and remain on top of the world," he said.

"Winning a third world title is going to be amazing. It is always important for an athlete to win major championship titles and this is what I am actually looking forward to.

"It is also very important for my career because the world want to see how this champion can defend his title and how long he will stay at the top of their game."

Rudisha's times this year in his few outings have been modest compared to the likes of compatriot Emmanuel Korir and Botwana's Nijel Amos.

The same was true before Rio, however, and while he is conscious of the competition he will face at the world championships, Rudisha backs himself as a big race performer.

"There are upcoming athletes, but we are also happy to see the elite athletes still progressing and challenging and giving stiff competition to the younger lot," he said.

"I can't underrate anyone. When it comes to championships, we have seen athletes in their best form being beaten."

NASA presidential candidate Raila Odinga has castigated press reports indicating the coalition wants to boycott August 8 polls.

He said the statement, which was also attributed to Deputy President William Ruto, is false and that he only warned against rigging.

Raila said he has no reason to skip the general election which is 10 days away.

"I did not say we will boycott elections. We can't boycott elections. I said they should not try to use the military to rig elections," he told a rally in Kajiado on Friday.

"There is no way Jubilee can win this election other than through rigging. I have told them not to try it because Kenyans will not allow such acts."

His comments came just hours after he claimed Jubilee has already shipped in presidential ballot papers.

The Opposition leader claimed poll materials are hidden at a greenhouse for purposes of rigging.

But the IEBC said presidential ballot papers are to arrive from Dubai on July 31.

Raila hit at Jubilee saying Kenyans have grown tired of its leadership that has destroyed the economy through looting of public funds.

He accused the Uhuru Kenyatta administration of presiding over a regime that prides itself in overseeing corruption.


The Opposition chief claimed Jubilee has stolen about Sh350 billion shillings since ascending to power in 2013.

"Kenyans have a reason, the will, and the power to vote out Jubilee."

MAGUFULI-STYLE RULE

Raila further said he will borrow a leaf from Tanzanian President John Magufuli in dealing with corruption.

He said a NASA government will seal all loopholes used to steal public funds and use the monies to actualise its pre-campaign promises.

Raila cited the construction of low-cost housing, free secondary education and the establishment of a special fund for widows and single parents as some of the promises.

"Don’t worry about where the money will come from. All the plans we have will cost about Sh10 billion," he said. "So the money is more than enough to implement all our promises."

The Opposition chief called on Kajiado residents to turn out in numbers and vote overwhelmingly for NASA and its affiliate candidates on August 8.

"I have even asked Governor David Nkedianye to order ambulances to transport the sick from hospitals to go and vote."

Raila used the occasion to endorse NASA candidates vying for various seats.DP WIlliam Ruto addresses a rally at Kapenguria town in West Pokot during a campaign tour on Thursday.Pic\Charles Kimani\DPP

American writer Minna Antrim, author of the book ‘Naked Truth and Veiled Allusions’ says, “To be loved is to be fortunate, to be hated is to achieve distinction.”
Deputy President William Ruto has achieved nearly as much distinction in being hated as he has been fortunate in being loved. This in a nutshell, is the Ruto paradox. How is it that someone evokes so much love/hate emotions every time he starts to speak? On July 12, a crowd in Kisumu recently shouted to the President Uhuru Kenyatta’s face, “Hatutaki Ruto!” yet the same crowd (most likely) had been on hand to shout DP Ruto’s praise, when he was an ODM Pentagon member in 2007. This phenomenon is of course not new to Ruto. Jesus also had a similar problem. Those who shouted “crucify him!” had been the same crowd that had days earlier sung to him, “Hosanna in the highest!”, as he entered Jerusalem on the back of a donkey.

THE POLITICS OF THE RESTIVE MAJORITY

If Jubilee will win this election, they will owe it to one man — Ruto. Conversely, if they lose, they will blame it on man — Ruto. It’s that plain and simple. It only depends on how the Deputy President will play with the mind of the restive majority. There are those who are going to vote, not against Uhuru but against Ruto. There are also those who are also going to vote, not for Uhuru but for his deputy. In fact, Uhuru seems to have somehow insulated himself against the politics of Kenya’s restless voter. The Deputy President isn’t there yet. He is wrestling with him.

YESTERDAY’S LOVERS AND TODAYS LOATHERS

Nearly every Kenyan politician or voter has at one time exhibited the two emotions towards Ruto —intense love and intense hatred. There are also those that have felt the same emotions about him at the same time. In 2005, most of his current haters loved him to bits for delivering the Rift Valley against President Mwai Kibaki and Amos Wako’s nefarious draft constitution.

In 2007, he again delivered the Rift Valley to his then friend-turned-foe Raila Odinga. The ODM camp loved him in no uncertain terms as much as the PNU side loathed him. In 2010, his haters and lovers switched camp and the haters did their thing on him for opposing the Constitution, which was eventually passed in the referendum. In the aftermath of the 2007 post-election violence, that loathing did land him in the ICC and, indeed, it was a period of great uncertainty for those who loved him.

SCAPEGOATING RUTO

The love-loathe relationship with Ruto has morphed into something new — scapegoating. Since about this time last year, nearly every politician with political problems has found a new reason —Ruto. Oh, it doesn’t matter from which side of the political divide they were or they are. If the nominations went badly — the Deputy President became the convenient scapegoat, the ultimate fall guy. They accused him of everything from raising and financing opponents to bringing up ‘projects’ and imposing them on the people. It reached a point where it was very difficult for a new political entrant to get things going without first looking at how their association with Ruto (real or perceived) would be interpreted by their opponents. Indeed, the tag of ‘Ruto project’ became a killer punch on newcomers across the country and his close associates.

SO MUCH LOVING

Then there are those who openly admire his charisma and energy of a young ox. His eloquence, self-assurance and buoyancy have attracted millions to him. His audacious political positions and never shying away from a fight is the base of his followers, who find in him a hero-leader to trust their vote with. To others his greatness lies in closing ranks with the Kikuyu, whom the Kalenjins had identified as their perennial competitors for resources. This relationship had predictable conflict cycles edged around elections and with disastrous outcomes. Give it to him. He has applied his massive energies to bring this election home for Jubilee against all odds. And this may just be the reason he attracts so much loathing, or loving.


ENEMY MAKING

Another Ruto paradox is his affinity for enemy making. NASA principals are seemingly in a fight against Ruto not even with Uhuru. Their strategy has been to paint the pot black (there was already some black) and shout from the rooftops how black he is when they can hardly exonerate themselves from similar claims against them. Ruto, understanding this, has stated that they should not bring the war to his person but wait until 2022, when he will be on the ballot like the others. His list of enemies is long. When he joined active politics sometime in 1992, he had a great friend in one Cyrus Jirongo. When Jacob Juma was shot dead in May last year, Jirongo came out accusing Ruto of killing him. He, however, chose not to take Jirongo to court but instead chose one Ngeno Masaas Laluk (Boniface Mwangi’s nom de guerre) and dragged him by the ears to court. The matter threatened to get ugly but it seemed Ruto was raring to go. Ruto’s enemies trooped to Laluk’s side emasculating the feeble activist’s hand to throw a punch at Ruto. It soon emerged to us that there was a closeted love-child which was thought would deeply embarrass the DP. He quickly owned up to it and asked, “What more dirt do you have? Bring it on!” We all went quiet.

CUTTING BRIDGES

Another interesting aspect of the DP’s style of power play is his ability to cut bridges and consign his enemies to the dogs. Ruto is not always a great bridge-builder. Instead of reaching out to those he has wronged, he would rather have them go over to the other side and remain there, bringing down the bridge and waiting to see what they will do. There are many people opposing him now who have been his bosom friends, including Governor Isaac Rutto, Senator Gideon Moi, Cyrus Jirongo, Peter Kenneth, Senator Boni Khalwale, Musalia Mudavadi, Kalonzo Musyoka, Senator Moses Wetang’ula, Charity Ngilu and even NASA leader Raila Odinga. The list is long, very long in fact. How does he convert so many friends into such powerful enemies? Unless of course he did not consider them his friends in the first place. In fact he was ready to let go of Kanu and has little or no love for its chairman Gideon, who has never shared a podium with him except in funerals despite publicly pledging to ‘support’ Jubilee.

Ruto is even on record for asking the people of Baringo to elect Jubilee Senate candidate Simon Chelugui and vote Gideon out. This has reduced Gideon to fight for his political life in his Baringo backyard instead of coming out to defend Jubilee against NASA onslaught. Nick Salat, another powerful campaigner would have been booming across the country for Jubilee but has been reduced to his Bomet backyard trying to survive politically. All of these are wasted resources on the ground, which would have been better utilised to defend Jubilee.

SNUBBING THE DEBATE

Another aspect of the Paradox of Ruto is the blur between the obvious and the absurd. We are still yet to understand what got into Ruto and his boss Uhuru to snub such an excellent forum to sell their policies. Who snubs political debates in this day and age?

Even President Yoweri Museveni actually debated his perennial enemy Dr Kizza Besigye ahead of the last Ugandan elections. Like millions of Kenyans, I eagerly awaited the debate to see how the candidates would perform. On the material day, a friend asked me to join him to attend the debate at CUEA. I jumped at the offer. But when we arrived at the gate, we were turned back when they discovered we had no tickets. We were frisked by the hawk-eyed security and our car checked by sniffer dogs in what turned out to be a well-organised security programme. We did not know we needed tickets. So we quickly made for a nearby restaurant to watch the debate on TV. We, however, sat waiting for hours in vain. My friend, however, happened to have the DP Ruto’s number, sent him a passionate plea to show up for the debate, but he ignored the text just the same. He instead treated us to an hour and a half of a quasi-diatribe by someone we were all seeing for the first time. Between us we agreed that we probably didn’t quite understand this UhuRuto duo, described by Mutahi Ngunyi as the ‘Ferrari’ candidacy as opposed to NASA’s ‘matatu’ candidacy (all inclusive).

FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS

Another paradox is the DP’s stand on the TJRC Report. Yes, he is mentioned in the report, but largely on minor issues some of which he has already dealt with. His role in the 2007-08 PEV is mentioned and by the time the report was released, he was already appearing before the ICC. His discussion of the Wagalla Massacre on the floor of the House on October 18, 2000 came under scrutiny but not much else save for a recommendation the he be prosecuted together with others on matters relating to land, and for that he has already had his day in court. He should, therefore, be the last man to have sleepless nights over the report any more than President Uhuru or even Raila should. But there are millions of Kenyans who needlessly suffered the grind of the Kanu machine and also in subsequent regimes. DP Ruto should personally know the pain of being falsely accused before an international court, which is why his stand is just another paradox. How should he let the tears of millions flow in vain? Perhaps that stand on the TJRC Report should bring him to the words of Donne in his famous line, “And, therefore, never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.”CoG chair Josphat Nanok during a press briefing at the COG building in Westlands./victor imboto

A day after NASA leader Raila Odinga campaigned in Turkana county, opinion polls have given Governor Josphat Nanok (ODM) a major lead against his rival John Munyes (Jubilee).

Nanok (pictured) says he is excited that residents of Turkana will give him a second term.

Infotrak opinion polls released on Thursday indicate that Nanok will get more than 77.7 per cent of the votes against 14.3 per cent for Munyes who is leading the Jubilee race in the region.


But Munyes has rejected the survey as “fake polls tailored to mislead voters”.

He said residents will decide at the ballot.Hundreds of members from the Luhya community living in Nairobi on Saturday endorsed Senator Mike Sonko’s bid for Nairobi governor seat.

The group, numbering about 1000, consisted of members from 18 Luhya sub tribes drawn from all the 17 constituencies.

The meeting which was organized by Team Sonko was held at the All African Churches Conference hall, Nairobi.

Sonko and his deputy Polycarp Igathe are seeking to dethrone incumbent governor Evans Kidero of ODM at the August polls.

The duo are the Jubilee party nominees for the seat.

The seat has also attracted the interest of Peter Kenneth and Miguna Miguna who are both running as independent candidates.

Others are Waweru Godfrey and Mumo Michael.


The Luhya delegation also endorsed Johnson Sakaja for the Nairobi senator seat.

The endorsement could prove to be a boost to Sonko who a recent opinion poll suggested was enjoying equal popularity with Kidero within Nairobi.

The survey by Infotrak released on Friday said the two were tied at 45 per cent on popularity barometer with just nine days to the polls.

The poll said Sakaja (Jubilee) enjoys a 50 per cent backing by those surveyed followed by his closest rival ODM’s Edwin Sifuna at 28 per cent.

The other contestants for both seats had less than 5 per cent approval rating.FACEBOOK

Relieved that food is on the way, I slowly try and answer all the shopkeeper’s questions. I decide to leave out the more complicated bits of the story. Her son has returned with the food and I end up sharing my fries with him as he keeps eyeing them longingly. He wolfs them down. She berates him but I say it’s ok and lie that I have had my fill. Mr N will be here soon; I’ll eat again soon enough.

The slippers feel good on my feet and the sweet tea has given my low blood sugar a boost. By the time Mr N gets to the shop, I’m all talked out. He pulls up in a car that I’ve never seen before: a white, beaten-down pick-up truck. He’s also dressed strangely. A little rough, wearing a baseball cap. Mr N is always impeccably dressed. Why does he look like a farm hand?

“I almost didn’t recognise you,” I say, trying and failing to run into his arms. I sit back on the stool after just taking a few steps.

“It’s ok, I’ll carry you,” he says when he sees the plasters on my feet.

“Thanks for taking care of her,” he says to the shopkeeper and gets his wallet out. Her eyes brighten up as he pulls out a wad of notes and hands them to her.

He then turns to me and swoops me up into his arms. I hang onto him, tightly. My hero. The boy waves goodbye but his mother is too busy counting the money Mr N has handed to her to bother with similar oscillations.

“Are you ok?” Mr N asks, his voice full of concern.

“I am now,” I say, not wanting to let go of him when he places me in the passenger seat.

“What’s with the car?” I ask.

“I was at my farm all day,” he says.

I only ever see him wearing suits and driving Range Rovers, but it makes sense that he wouldn’t be in any of those while visiting a farm.

“You said Nabil did this?” he asks, changing the subject.

I nod, the tears I’ve been fighting back falling freely now.

“We left the restaurant. I fell asleep in the car and when I woke up I was locked up in a room in some house a few kilometres away from here.

“Nabil was gone,” I continue. “I was being watched by some guy called Bill.”

“And how do you know Nabil has anything to do with this?” he asks suspiciously.


“How the hell did I get there if he didn’t take me?” I ask, irritated.

“Show me!” he says.

“Show you what? The house?” I ask, terrified that he wants me to return there.

“Yes! I’ll kill him!” he says.

“I told you, he’s not there,” I say. “There’s more….”

“Yes?” he asks.

“The reason they wanted me there was to sell my body to clients,” I say.

“You can’t be serious,” he says, looking shocked. “I just can’t see Nabil being involved in this.”

“I think we should let the police be the judge of that. Shouldn’t we go straight to the station and report it?”

“Yes, of course. Let’s do that,” he says, sounding distracted. “It’s just that…”

“Just what?” I ask.

“How will you tell them you met Nabil? Where will you say you were going with him?” he asks.

“Why not tell them the truth?” I ask him.

“No, no,” he says, shaking his head. “I don’t want to be involved in any of this."

This guy is beginning to piss me off.

“Shouldn’t you have thought about that before you introduced me to some psycho criminal?” I ask.Linda Wafula

If you are not at the table, you are on the menu, so said American politician Michael Enzi.

Women have continuously been told to fight for their space at the top and ‘lean in’, as Facebook chief operations officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote in her debut book, which has become the career bible for many women.

Leaning in is a concept politician and social entrepreneur Lindy Wafula lives by. A mantra that has led her to undertake ventures to economically empower women in rural areas.

She spoke to the Star about her journey through politics and social entrepreneurship and what she has learnt about women in leadership during the 11 years she has lived in Sweden.

Beginnings

Lindy was brought up in Kaloleni by her father, the late Stanley Wafula, who was the coach of Black Mamba FC, and her mother, the late Domitilla Fwaya, who was the sister to former Kaloleni councillor James Fwaya.

Unfortunately, Lindy’s parents succumbed to HIV and Aids when she was only 14 years old, and she had to become a breadwinner for her family.

Lindy was forced to acquire an entrepreneurial spirit at a young age to sustain herself and her family and get an education.

Before she ever ventured into politics and social entrepreneurship, Lindy worked in the media. She studied journalism at the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication and upon graduation, she started a private media school.

That was not to last, however, because it was a capital-intensive undertaking,as she needed to buy expensive equipment and she did not have the people to fund the project.

The banks did not have much faith in the project and refused to fund it.

After this stint failed, Lindy got an opportunity to travel to the Netherlands to work, and while there, she nurtured her public speaking skills and started speaking at conferences.

In the process, she met her husband and that is how she ended up moving to Sweden.

When Lindy moved to Sweden, she noticed something that seemed to ring true across most Scandinavian countries: women make a significant percentage of the people holding senior positions in government and boards.

Women in Parliament

In Sweden, women make up 45 per cent of the people in Parliament.

Lindy asked herself why women back in Kenya were not doing the same.

Before Parliament was adjourned, there were 86 women in Parliament: 16 elected MPs, 47 woman representatives, five nominated MPs and 18 nominated senators. Women’s representation stood at 21 per cent.

In the corporate sector, women in Sweden make up 13 per cent of the leaders. This might sound small, but in Kenya, the figure is nowhere near that. The corporate sphere is an exclusive men’s club.

Sweden’s success in putting women in positions of power in politics inspired Lindy to try her hand at politics. But her climb up the ladder has been a tough one.

Lindy first plunged into the world of politics in 2010 during the Makadara MP by-election, but she stood no chance as she faced off against the flamboyant Mike Sonko (who is currently the Nairobi senator), who had loads of cash to splash in his bid for the seat.

In 2013, Lindy faced a similar fate when she ran for the seat on the Wiper ticket. She lost to Benson Mutura.

This time round, she has been nominated by Wiper for a special seat (gender) at the county assembly.

At a point, Lindy supported Reuben Ndolo’s bid for the Makadara seat, but that came at a cost.

“When you support a man in politics, people say all sorts of things. People said Ndolo was sponsoring me. They called me manzi wa Ndolo and abused me,” Lindy says.

Lindy says it is a tough call for a woman to decide to run for office.

“When I ran in 2013, I had to have a good number of people to offer me security. Thankfully, there were some good men who volunteered to go around with me and protect me. Women face a lot of intimidation when they run for office.”

UNGANOMICS


Lindy says part of the reason she did not run for office this year is because of the tactics used by some aspirants to win over voters.

“The way aspirants are competing now is just terrible. You will find them distributing unga then demanding votes. It’s not about the issues you want to solve, but what you will bribe residents with. It takes a toll on your moral values.”

In 2013, Lindy spent Sh5 million campaigning, and she says that was not enough, but it was all she could raise. There was also the human capital involved.

Lindy is now focused on social entrepreneurship.

Social entrepreneurship

Lindy runs an organisation called Village Ventures Kenya, which seeks to provide women in rural areas with skills to set up profitable businesses.

She has started projects in Makadara, Kwale and Busia that enable women to learn how to communicate efficiently in English and start profitable businesses.

Through Worldpulse, a social networking site exclusively for women, Lindy got a group to volunteer to regularly write letters to Kenyan women in the village to help improve their writing and reading skills.

Different kind of adult education

“Sometimes the adult education formula used does not work for people on the ground.You have to understand and resonate with their needs. When you write to someone and they write back, you get excited and want to continue the communication. But with textbook learning, it can feel one-sided, especially for adults.”

The programme has grown to include a cultural exchange element.

Junk into gold

Another project Lindy has gotten involved in is sending used computers back to her vocational training academy in Kenya.

In Europe, some citizens throw away gadgets that are still in a fairly decent condition and this gave Lindy the idea of collecting computers and sending them back to Kenya for rural women to use in the centres.

Another project Lindy has started is a woman mechanics programme, Lady Mekankika, an idea she borrowed from Sweden.

“Women in Sweden run garages. There is no reason women in Kenya cannot do the same,” she says.

The project provides young women with vocational training in mechanics.

Lindy’s vocational training centre, the Women’s Academy, has trained women in beauty, mechanics, catering, event planning and ICT.

Lindy says it has not been easy to start and sustain some projects, but her mantra in life is ‘never give up in trying to make a positive change’.

She says she has faced some biases in Sweden, because “some people think Africans are lazy”.

“I don’t let these biases slow me down. If you think I am a lazy African, I will work hard to show you that your perception is wrong,” Lindy says.

She has always been industrious. When she first moved to Sweden, she taught Kiswahili lessons and made baskets to make cash before she got a permanent job.

Opportunities in technology

Lindy is a big advocate for the use of technology. “We need to move away from women selling tomatoes under the hot sun. Everything can be made available online now. It’s no longer about working 40 hours a week for 40 years then you retire. Look for opportunities,” she says.

Lindy’s work has been recognised and she was listed as one of Africa’s Top 25 women in leadership for 2017 in the Amazon’s Watch magazine.

She has also received an award from the Centre for Economic and Leadership Development.

She concludes by saying, “It is time for women in Kenya to start a movement where they aim to be movers and shakers in the society.”
