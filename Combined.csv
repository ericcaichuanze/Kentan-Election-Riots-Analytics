The CCK Director General FRANCIS WANGUSI said the transmitters were being operated using unauthorised frequencies or the required licences.', 'The six transmitters that were dismantled belonged to the Royal Media Services owned by businessman SK Macharia. The regulator said the company has been self-assigning the frequencies and grabbing from other broadcasters. ', 'The company is said to be using over 40 frequencies that are illegally acquired and has erected transmitters in non-designated sites. This has far-reaching consequences in the communication industry as well as in aviation. Wangusi says CCK shut down of the transmitters has just began. He spoke to our writer WINFRED KAGWE. ', 'One of the broadcasters, Royal Media Services, has been engaging in illegal activities by putting up transmitters all over the country without CCK permission. The company has also been illegally acquiring radio and TV frequencies by taking them up without our permission or taking what has been assigned to its competitors. ', 'The Kenya Information and Communications Act, 1998, Section 35 outlaws the setting up and operation of communications apparatus without authorisation from CCK. ', 'Through our investigations we have established that Royal Media has over 40 illegally gotten frequencies. Some 17 of them - five for TV and 12 radio frequencies - were recently acquired. ', ""Today, six of the transmitter stations have been put off-air. They were were located in Narok, Nakuru, Mukuyuni in Ukambani and Mabrui in Malindi. There are other unauthorised masts in places like Nanyuki, Karue Hill, Vuria Hill, Enchoro Hill, Murang'a which we will also be shutting down in the next few days. "", 'These are not the only illegal transmitters. Between 2008 and 2012, Royal Media also acquired 24 frequencies, 22 FM and two TV, in the same manner. These are still in operation because of an ongoing court case where the Commission has been injuncted from taking any action. ', 'Between 2002 and 2006, Royal Media had grabbed 77 frequencies, 67 FM and 10 TV. ', 'CCK after consultations with the relevant government organs regularised these frequencies on the understanding that the broadcaster would stop using unauthorised frequencies and deploying transmitters in non-designated broadcasting sites. But they did not stop and this is impacting on our economy and safety. ', 'In our planning for frequencies, we normally liaise with the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority, National Environmental Management Authority, and local governments. ', ""This is to ensure that where we allocate frequencies or allow transmitter sites that do not interfere with flight paths, cause environmental degradation or interfere with councils' planning. These are the Designated Broadcasting Sites of a country. Kenya Civil Aviation Authority and Kenya Airways have lodged many complaints to us about threats to the safety of our airspace due to interferences from these illegal transmitters. "", 'The transmitter stations have on a number of occasions caused interferences to radio communication between pilots and the control tower. Also note, most of the transmitters are placed on top of hills and KCAA is not aware of this since we did not notify them; this means aircrafts can even crash in to them. So if someone wants to reach more customers, he is endangering the lives of people. ', 'Nema has also raised concerns that the transmitters are being erected without first meeting the requirement for environmental impact assessment. These could be emitting dangerous electromagnetic radiation so we are dealing with uncertainties here. We are also supposed to co-ordinate use of radio communication services. ', 'For starters, Citizen is not paying for the frequencies. If these were to be assigned to another player they would be paying; so the government is losing resources which would have been directed towards other projects.', ' The annual fees for TV is Sh360,000 while for radio it is Sh136,000 for each frequency. Actually,Kenya is one of the cheapest places to broadcast in. ', 'Illegally acquiring frequencies is also causing unfair competition in the market. Citizen is not paying while others are, and yet they are using the wider reach to convince advertisers to pay more in the stations. This unfavorable competition is jeopardising investments in the ICT sector. Also one person having too many frequencies is not the kind of diversity we are looking for. ', ""This is also causing conflict among the broadcasters because these frequencies are grabbed from the duly licensed users. The others that are self assigned are causing interferences on other users' frequencies. In some instances, the interferences are so intense that the services of other broadcasters using duly authorised frequencies have been rendered completely inoperable. "", 'We have also noted that more TV transmitters are being set up and as you know the rest of the world is moving to digital TV transmission. I suspect the TV transmitters being set up by the company are technologies being dumped here from the countries that have migrated. It is going to cost the government a lot of money to get rid of the e-waste. ', ""No one else; it's only Royal Media. We have been doing our investigations across the country. We have the locations of the transmitters, the period they are estimated to have been in operation and they all belong to Royal Media. "", 'Spectrum is a limited resource and when other broadcasters come to us asking for more, we are forced to turn them down, because we do not have much to assign. Yet the following day they hear Royal Media has new frequencies. ', 'Even when the other broadcasters are turned down on frequency allocation, they have never resorted to this. ', 'We have on various occasions tried to take action. The 77 frequencies Citizen acquired between 2002 and 2006, the government ordered us to regularise this. When they continued, anytime we approached Macharia, he was being protected by some officials in government then. In 2010, he started going to court knowing he no longer had the protection, and as as you know our courts have not been too clean so he has been getting injunction stopping us from taking action. ', 'Let me also admit that as CCK we may be having an internal problem. Because for one person to go on with this, he must have assistance from the inside. I have not been at the helm of CCK for long, but I suspect this has been going on. This is why I have come up forcefully to try to clean up. ', 'How did CCK arrive at the decision to bring down the transmitters ?', ' By the time we came to this decision, we had done a lot of communication through writing to the company, to see how we can reverse this. But Royal Media is acting in impunity and continuing with this practice. ', 'As we speak, there is a station they have started in Teso in Malaba which we have not authorised. They have put transmitters there which are just next to Tororo in Uganda, and you know anything near the border we want to know how far does it go to Uganda and does the Ugandan authorities allow that. This is the kind of co-ordination that only CCK can do. ', 'We have received complaints for Coast that they have put up a station in Msambweni that is interfering with Kaya FM. The owners of the station wrote to us and said they are either going to ban it or also erect theirs to interfere. ', ""We saw that the cases are rising as they are putting up new ones everyday. You know if they stop and we deal with the frequencies he has already acquired, we would be talking about the possibility of assisting him regularise them. It's just causing anarchy in the ICT sector. "", 'Some of the broadcaster have threated to take legal action because we do not seem to be taking our work seriously.Transmissions from these illegal stations are also causing interferences in neighbouring countries, eliciting complaints from regulators in the region. ', 'We are also not going to compromise on the security of our airspace, especially during this election period. ', 'Yes. On Monday (today) we are going to take him to court because this is a criminal offense. The Communications Act, Cap 4 clearly states this is a criminal act attracting penalty of Sh5 million fine or three-year imprisonment or both. ', 'We will use some of the apparatus we have uprooted as evidence. The court already ruled in our favour, but it gave him time to appeal. Once the court finalises we are going to get rid of all these transmitters. ', 'We have already stopped issuing new TV frequencies in preparation for this. But you see they have recently increased the number of TV transmitters. This is however not going to affect the migration. When the time to switch off analogue comes, all will be shut down whether they were acquired legally or illegally.', ' ', ' ', 'The Communications Commission of Kenya on Saturday morning shut down\nsix Royal Media Services broadcast transmitters in Nakuru, Narok,\nMukuyuni (Makueni) and Mabrui (Malindi) which were being operated\nwithout a licence and using unauthorised or grabbed frequencies. ', 'The six are part of 17 transmitters put up illegally by Royal\nMedia Services in the recent past without a licence from CCK, and\ntherefore in contravention of the law. Some of the transmitters are\nlocated in non-designated broadcasting sites thus causing interferences\nto other critical services including aviation. A further 22 FM and two\nTV unauthorised frequencies that Royal Media Services acquired in the\nsame manner between 2008 and 2012 are pending adjudication in the\ncourts. ', 'Section 35 of the Kenya Information and Communications Act, 1998,\noutlaws the setting up and operation of communications apparatus\nwithout authorisation from CCK.

', 'In some instance the interferences are so intense that the\nservices of other broadcasters using duly authorised frequencies have\nbeen rendered completely inoperable, said Wangusi. ', 'He added that the safety of our airspace was under threat as\nthese illegal transmitters had on a number of occasions caused\ninterferences to communication between pilots and the control tower at\nour main airports. ', 'The Commission shall in the next few days shut down the remaining\n11 illegal stations to ensure that all players in the broadcasting\nsector operate within the law. ', 'CCK is the only state organ charged with the responsibility of\nmanaging Kenyas frequency spectrum. Central management of the frequency\nspectrum is critical in ensuring orderly exploitation of this scarce\nand limited resource, and to avoid interferences among various spectrum\nusers. ', 'All spectrum users, therefore, are required to operate under a\nlicence issued by CCK and which must be kept in force through adherence\nto the operational parameters stipulated in the licence. Wangusi said\nthe grab up of frequencies had no place in Kenya, in view of the\nexisting institutional framework in place for managing frequencies. ', 'Unauthorised use of spectrum amounts to an act of impunity and\nflies in the face of the regulatory requirement to provide an equal\nplatform for all players. It also denies the regulator of spectrum\nresources to address the policy objectives of plurality and diversity,\nand to cater for devolution requirements as envisaged in the\nconstitution.

What words would he use to explain why he believed that words themselves, in the form of titles, were trivial? One of us longing for words; the other explaining why they were not necessary - the irony made me smile.', 'On Sunday, January 27, Helmuth and Erica Rossler-Musch opened their second exhibition at the Red Hill Art Gallery, a private gallery built just outside their home. Through NGO work and extensive travel throughout Africa, the intriguing couple have accumulated a large collection of African art. Settled between Banana Hill and Ngecha Village, they put up a modest gallery last year, to exhibit both their personal art collection and, every so often, the works of a different contemporary African artist.', 'In September 2012, they showcased the work of the late Geoffrey Musaka, who was a prominent Ugandan artist of international acclaim. This time, they are exhibiting works by Ahmed Abushariaa, a popular Sudanese artist living in Kampala. The exhibition, which will end in April, is open to the public on weekends and by appointment during the week. With over 50 paintings on show, it is a fusion of works from 1993 to 2012 - the largest showing of Abushariaas art in Kenya to date.', 'We were living in Kampala when we met Abushariaa and have been in touch ever since, says Hellmuth Rossler. We have a large collection of his work, only a few of which are in the current show. But Abushariaas romance with Kenya began long before this exhibition. In 1992, I came to Nairobi on a bus. I didnt speak any English, he tells us.', ' An old Mennonite couple, Bill and Betty Baumann from the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) took me in and showed me how to promote my art. I worked at Paa ya Paa Gallery then. The Baumanns returned to Philadelphia and Abushariaa says he thinks about them often and still hears from them once in a while.', 'In 1990, Abushariaa graduated with a B.A. in Fine Arts from the College of Fine and Applied Arts from Sudan University. He worked as a graphic designer for two years and left for Kenya when the military took over in Sudan. In 1994, after two years in Kenya, he moved to Cologne, Germany where he continued working as a contemporary artist. Visiting Kampala as an exhibiting artist at the AKA Gallery, he met his wife, fell in love and decided to stay.', 'Today, Abushariaa is a celebrated international artist who has permanent exhibitions in Kenya, Uganda, Sudan and South Africa. He has exhibited in Europe, the US, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Australia and is a member of the Sudanese Artists Association, the Drawing Society and the South African Society of Artists. An upbeat, creative soul, whose work speaks to so many people across the globe, he is the real McCoy; a successful contemporary African artist.', 'Abushariaas blurred watercolours, nostalgic of his homeland, express sentiments from the 20-year war in South Sudan and the genocide of the Nubian people. At the time he fled Sudan, the authorities had banned artists from sharing such sentiments. ', 'Today, that is exactly what Abushariaa does. With hints of old and new Sudan, distinct elements of Nubian culture, Nubian symbolism and Arabic calligraphy, Abushariaas works indulge the senses, and are almost too much to bear when all in one room.', 'Each Abushariaa painting, semi-abstract and often made of several miniature paintings in one, deserves its own space. At the current exhibition, the powerful images, delightful colour and ambient form can be overwhelming. You see imagery reminiscent of rock-art; warm, organic watercolour paintings in oranges and browns; neat works in bright colours with a graphic-design feel; collages made of recycled material and newspaper, and his latest works of acrylic on canvas.', 'And so - Abushariaa gives me a moment of his time. I feel when you give a painting a title, you dictate the painting, he says. He believes it is counterproductive to confine an interpretation because people will not come up with their own ideas. ', 'If I called a painting The Festival, you would look for a festival and miss everything else. I enjoy paintings where there are several stories to see. People sometimes tell me to simplify my works but I like to have many pictures and then leave my work untitled. Titles make things confusing. I want to keep my paintings free, open to interpretation, with no restrictions at all. ', 'From different phases in his evolution, and using a different technique in each painting, Abushariaa has two works in opposite corners of the gallery that convey a similar sentiment. ', 'From a series of striking black and white ink works, there is an image of a stark, white silhouette, a female in Muslim dress, against a convoluted cityscape of black, grey and hints of white. ', 'On a small wall in a corner, there is an image where a colourful townscape occupies only the top third of paper. White desert fills the rest of the space, with only a few indistinguishable figures in traditional dress scampering in the nothingness.', 'Composing the foreground in the first painting and almost all of second one, Abushariaas use of negative space is profound. He feels no pressure to paint the whole picture or fill the void. Its also unclear whether the people in his paintings are moving toward or away from town. Playing with the ideas of isolation and identity, of belonging and not, many of his works look at the individual as he or she reflects upon their nation, their hometown, their culture and the doctrines propagated therein.', 'Using sweltering colours and sensitive imagery, Ahmed Abushariaa contemplates the things we all do. Who are we? Who am I in this context and who am I separate from it? Until either he has the answer or we do, his paintings will remain untitled.', '\n']"

However farmers have found a new innovative way to turn worn out tyres into a mobile vegetable garden.', 'Just as people plant vegetables in sacks, old tyres can also be recycled and used to plant kales, onions or crops that do not have tubers due to limited space.', 'The tyre-vegetable-gardens are a solution to city homes or the informal settlements to help cut the cost of buying everyday vegetables and also improve the family diet.', 'Ben Momanyi, a technician at the Institute for Biotechnology Research, organic section at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology says you save on time and energy as you do not have to till land or even a garden to grow your vegetables.', 'By doing so, you also minimise on space because anybody can grow vegetables in tyres and put them in a veranda, corridor or balcony. All you need is a small spot to put the tyre and you are ready to do gardening, Momanyi says.', 'He attests that small spaces can be well utilised using simple skills and people in towns and villages can also practice organic farming right at their door steps. It also allows you to grow a variety of crops in one tyre.', 'With a tyre, another advantage is that it is portable and in case you are moving houses, you can carry it with you, he explains.', 'Research has shown that there is no appreciable risk in using recycled tires in the vegetable garden. While it is a fact that rubber tires do contain minute amounts of certain heavy metals, the compounds are tightly bonded within the actual rubber compound and do not leach into the soil. One of the ingredients in the rubber recipe is zinc. Zinc, in fact, is an essential plant element.', 'Also the black rubber of the tyres will absorb warmth from the sun during the day, and will hold the heat, keeping plants warm into the evening hours.', 'In Kenya, majority of the daily budget goes towards purchasing food especially in the urban households where most of the population earns less than two dollars a day.', 'According to the Food Agricultural Organisation, home gardens have a great potential to improve food security at the household level and alleviate micronutrients deficiencies. Further stating that when access to land and water is not a major limitation, a well-developed home garden has the potential to supply most of the daily non-staple food a family needs and hence save of food bill.', 'How to make your own easy and economical mobile vegetable process.', 'First of all lay the tire at the spot where you want it. Then you can use a knife to cut the sidewall completely out of the upper side of the tyre. This helps to nearly double the planting area available.', 'Then prepare compost from well decomposed materials, and spread a plastic bag at the base of the tyre. You need to ensure the bag is strong enough as this will form the foundation of the tyre-vegetable-garden.', ""Mix your compost manure thoroughly with soil. This is a crucial part as the soil feeds the plant so it must be well prepared. Then put the mixture in the well-established foundation and add water ensuring it is evenly distributed. As the water settles, get your ready seedlings and plant them. Avoid using regular garden soil, which will become hard and compacted once it's placed in the tire, and can also contain weed seeds and insects, Momanyi explains."", 'You can plant kales, spinach, green (non-bulb forming) onions or the black night shade; however it is not advisable to plant tubers such as potatoes and carrots because of the depth of the tubers.', 'Indigenous vegetables are best for this kind of farming as a farmer can harvest them for as long as one year before planting again. Hybrid on the other hand have a lifespan of between five to six months but either way they both give the end produce and help in saving time and money.', 'You can do finishing touches by mulching which helps the soil in retaining moisture and prevents weeds from growing. From then on you only need to keep watering your crops, said Momanyi.', 'For safety measures, you can put the tire-vegetable-garden in a raised platform to protect the plants from birds especially chicken.', 'If your tire garden is placed on concrete, raise the tyre slightly by placing it on boards, cement blocks or bricks to allow air flow under the tyre.', 'Momanyi says they train farmers once a month and encourage them to train others on these simple but useful skills. He advises farmers to embrace organic farming which is readily available and is often free from many pests and diseases.', 'We encourage people to intercrop and this is one of the principles of organic farming so that if one crop fails there is another one that will survive. Some crops also help each other in fighting pests for instance onions help scare off some pests, he said.', '\n']"

Such obligation includes the duty to promote, protect and fulfil the right to vote. The court observed that the respondents had violated the rights of persons in prisons by failing to facilitate and promote their rights as prescribed under Article 83 (3) of the Constitution.', 'This ruling was elicited by a petition filed by Kituo Cha Sheria (petitioner) with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as the 1st respondent and the Attorney General as the 2nd respondent. The Legal Resources Foundation was enjoined as an interested party to the petition. The petitioner sought relief for violation of fundamental rights of prisoners to be registered as voters and their right to vote in the coming general election and other future elections and referenda.', 'It was the petitioners case that the exclusion of prisoners from the voter registration exercise by the IEBC violated the prisoners constitutional rights. It contended that Article 83 of the Constitution sets out the qualifications of a voter and being imprisoned did not disqualify a citizen from voting, and that the only prisoners precluded from voting were those who had been convicted of committing an election offence during the preceding five years. It was submitted that the only internal limitation to the right to vote related to the rights of persons in the diaspora to vote in Article 82(1) (e) which right was to be realised progressively. The petitioner sought orders that the High Court should compel the IEBC to extend the registration period for purposes of facilitating prisoners registration as voters.', 'Mr Muhoro, counsel appearing for the IEBC submitted that prisoners had the right to vote in the elections, contending that the IEBC had maintained the same registration and polling centres that were established and had continued to register voters in prison. However, he opposed the petition on the ground that the IEBC had taken measures to ensure that prisoners are registered and that it had taken adequate steps to ensure their right to vote.', 'The main issues for determination before court were whether the prisoners had a right to vote under the Constitution and whether that right had been violated by the respondents in the circumstances.', ' ', 'Determination by the Court:', '1. The Constitution as the supreme law is founded on the sovereignty of the people of Kenya. This sovereignty is exercised through voting for representatives in the National and County governments who exercise delegated authority of the people in accordance with Article 2. It is beyond argument then that the right to vote is fundamental to our system of government. ', '2. The Constitution, with its emphasis on the peoples sovereignty, the values on rule of law, equity, inclusiveness, equality, human rights as well as the right to vote guaranteed under Article 38 and the qualification of voters provided under Article 83 does not exclude prisoners from being registered to vote and consequently voting in an election.', '3. Apart from merely guaranteeing the right, the Constitution places upon the State and its agencies the positive responsibility to ensure that all the people of Kenya and particularly those who are marginalised or vulnerable are able to exercise this fundamental right. That responsibility is not a passive duty but an active one imposed by the Constitution and particularly the Bill of Rights on the State and all its instrumentalities. Thus the breach of the prisoners right to vote entailed failing by the respondents to take positive steps to facilitate, promote and fulfil that right. ', '4. Article 51 of the Constitution neither limits the rights and fundamental freedoms of prisoners, which include the right to register as a voter and to vote, nor does it diminish in any way the responsibilities of the IEBC to prisoners.

There mere fact of providing registration centres for prisoners cannot be adequate to facilitate the right to vote. Prisoners are vulnerable persons in society and they do not have access to information, documentation, electronic media and means to voluntarily register as voters like other free citizens.', '6. The duty to facilitate voting means that the IEBC must coordinate with other institutions to ensure that the right to vote is realized at least within the context of what can be realized within the realm of prisons. ', '7. Unlike the right of citizens in the diaspora, whose right to vote is to be realized progressively, the right for prisoners to vote is one that is immediate and the State and its agencies must comply with the obligations that require that this right be realized. Such obligation includes the duty to promote, protect and fulfil the right to vote. The respondents violated the rights of persons in prisons by failing to facilitate and promote their rights.', ' ', ' 8. The obligation of the Court is to give effect to the rights contained in the Bill of Rights and the fact that giving effect to these rights may be inconvenient cannot override constitutional imperatives. ', '9. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission must take necessary administrative arrangements even after the General Elections to ensure registration of prisoners like other citizens as mandated of it under Article 88 (4) (a) and the facilitation of the realization of the right to vote of all eligible inmates.

The uncontested evidence demonstrates that this petition would have been unnecessary had the IEBC answered the correspondence from the petitioner and interested party. In an era where the Constitution obliges public institutions to be accountable and transparent, it is important that public institutions respond to queries raised by civic minded citizens. I would hasten to add that the right of access to information guaranteed under Article 35 underpins the values in Article 10(c) of good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability. ', 'The court allowed the petition and directed the IEBC to facilitate, in conjunction with the prison and other government institutions, the exercise of the right of prisoners who had already registered as voters to do so in the coming general elections.

No-one at the Lands Ministry has been charged with any offense or disciplined to date. Ruto, Uhuru Kenyatta\'s running mate in the presidential election, bought the 86 acre farm in Turbo, Uasin Gishu in September 2008.', 'However Adrian Gilbert Muteshi then filed a case claiming that he had owned the farm since 1968.

Hosea said he never heard Muteshis name during the transaction.', 'Muteshi filed his case in 2010 accusing Ruto of grabbing his 100 acre farm in Turbo, Uasin Gishu District. He said he farmed the land until 1992 when his business was temporarily interrupted by tribal clashes. He resumed farming after the violence but had to abandon the farm again following the chaos after the disputed 2007 election.', 'He was informed that Ruto had taken over the land when he returned to his farm after the turmoil. Muteshi said his six workers were evicted from the farm.', 'He claimed he acquired the land in the Kaptabei Scheme in the 1960s from Mr Edmund who was the white settler owner. Muteshi said that he applied to the then Lands minister, the late Jackson Harvester Angaine, for approval to buy the land in May 1968, .

He signed a sale and loan agreement with the Settlement Fund Trustees at the same time and was expected to repay the loan over 30 years. However he only acquired a land title in 1989.', ""Muteshi must be honest. Allegations that he was at the farm in 2008 is actually a fraud.

Interdependence of financial and supply chains present monumental challenges for global stability.', 'In 2007, US Subprime mortgages tanked Asias hottest IPO markets, devastated European banks and hit global hedge funds in emerging markets. According to the World Economic Forum, fragile economies, unsustainable debt and environmental degradation are the big risks facing the global economy in 2013.', 'For Africa, this reality presents a new development context shaped by uncertainty, risk. Vulnerability in one country affects others in ways that were hitherto unimaginable. Socio-economic instability and ecological degradation in a single country inevitably reverberates throughout the continent.', 'Convergent economic and environmental challenges will continue to have dramatic impacts on millions of Africans, jeopardising progress towards poverty reduction, eradication of chronic hunger and disease control. High food, energy and commodity prices, persistent income inequality, climate change and environmental degradation cast a long shadow on our collective prosperity.', 'Public policy is the best mechanism we have to deal with collective challenges. Policies are broad statements of purpose and process for addressing a particular social, economic or environmental issue. The intent of policy is implemented through regulatory, economic, expenditure and institutional tools. American philosopher, John Dewey, argued that policies must be treated as experiments, with the aim of promoting continual learning and adaptation in response to experience over time.', 'Whether the goal is to address infant mortality or free education or water and sanitation or energy or agriculture or conservation, policy-and decision-makers face significant uncertainty. Policies that cannot perform effectively under dynamic and uncertain conditions face the risk of not achieving the intended purpose, and undermining the capacity of societies to cope with or adapt to change.', 'In a world fraught with uncertainty we need a resilience approach to policy design and implementation. The concept of resilience first appeared in ecological lexicon with C. S. Hollings seminal paper, Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems in 1973. Resilience is the capacity for adaptive renewal through transformation and reorganization after disturbance.', 'Resilience has emerged as an important organising idea when thinking about policy and management action appropriate to the magnitude of risk and uncertainty we face today. The theme of the just concluded 2013 World Economic Forum was Resilient Dynamism. Resilience is now widely used to communicate the idea that a society or economy or ecological systems have the capacity to absorb shocks and disturbances with minimal disruption.', 'Resilience thinking in policy design and implementation is really about an adaptive approach, which takes into account the fact that the future is not knowable and manageable. An adaptive approach to policy making understands and appreciates dynamics, uncertainty and complexity of socio-economic and ecological interactions.', 'An adaptive approach to policy making could make societies and economies more resilient to external shock and supple in response to rapid change and surprise. Some policy scholars have suggested that we should treat policy making as gardening: muddy, attentive and experiential, because we have no idea what growing conditions will prevail.', 'I argue that public policy must be designed to be more flexible and adaptive, to respond to unanticipated conditions in order to reduce the risks of policy failure as foundational assumptions of their design come against the headwinds of change.', 'Building adaptive policy is not the task of a single actor or a single sector, no matter how innovative. Rather, building adaptive public policy, which, are resilient over time, requires building foresight, forging coalitions across society, decentralising decision authority and committing to continual learning. ', 'The capacity of a policy to adapt to anticipated and unanticipated conditions can be facilitated using some simple process mechanisms.', 'Integrated foresight planning and analysis: Identifying multiple drivers, which determine policy design is critical to understanding how the implementation and targeted outcomes might evolve across a range of contexts. ', 'Multi-stakeholder consultation: Collaborative processes strengthen policy design by providing a comprehensive understanding of key drivers and recognising common values, identifying shared commitment and anticipating emergent issues', 'Enabling decentralisation: Decentralising of the authority and responsibility for decision-making to the lowest effective and accountable unit of governance can enhance policy responsiveness and relevance to the local context. ', 'Continuous learning: Regular review, even when the policy is delivering its objectives, and the use of well-designed indicators can strengthen monitoring, and inform policy learning and continual adaptation. ', 'The imperative to reconcile economic, social and environmental well being has never been more urgent. Moreover, the condition under which policy-makers must work has never more complex and uncertain. We must therefore face the future differently by building a resilient society; a society that responds to change and crisis through continual learning, adaptive renewal and reorganisation.', ' ', 'Dr. Awiti is an Ecosystems Ecologist based at Aga Khan University in Nairobi', '\n']"

', 'So far, there are three leading presidential tickets slugging it out for top honours the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) led by Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the Jubilee Coalition of Uhuru Kenyatta and the Amani Coalition of Musalia Mudavadi.', 'In this regard, voting wisely would mean choosing one of these coalitions above the rest. But given the nature of our society, the history of our country and the challenges we face today, what should Kenyans consider most in order to vote wisely?', 'The issue majority of Kenyans will, undoubtedly, be considering most when they cast their ballots on March 4 is which leadership can be trusted with the implementation of the new constitution. In this regard, the implementation of the constitution will, most likely, be the top issue on the mind of majority of voters.', 'History shows that the March 4 elections present the same challenges the nation faced 50 years ago when the country attained independence in 1963.', 'At independence, the aspirations of Kenyans lay in the new structure of government that was anchored on a constitution based on devolution of power and resources, equity in distribution and sharing of national resources and a two-chamber parliament to ensure effective representation of the people.', 'But all those aspirations died and vaporized because the leadership that took over government was not committed to principles of devolution, equity and effective representation that the independence constitution espoused. Upon taking over power, they mutilated the constitution because they did not believe in it, thus killing the aspirations of Kenyans for good governance, equity, devolution and effective representation. ', 'Looking at the March 4 elections, one notices that the aspirations of majority of Kenyans, like in 1963, lie in the new constitution which provides for devolution, equitable distribution of resources, fairness in land use and ownership, two-chamber parliament, etc. ', 'The question, therefore, is who among the available coalitions can be trusted to uphold the letter and spirit of the new constitution? To answer, lets look back into history.', 'As the independence of African countries became fait accompli by the mid 1950s, certain powerful selfish interests had feared the coming of majority rule in Kenya. Nonetheless, the British government had to acknowledge that Africans could no longer be excluded from the political process in Kenya.', 'In this regard, the British administration introduced the Lyttleton Plan of 1957 under which the first African representatives were elected to the Legislative Council (LEGCO) of Kenya. ', 'They were Mboya, Ngala, Moi, Mate, Ogundu, Muliro, Odinga and Muimi their first legislative act was to reject the proposed Lyttleton Constitution which was an interim reform document meant to last until 1960, but which ensured the continued dominance of European members in decision-making.', 'After rejecting the Lyttleton Constitution, the African Legco members formed the African Elected Members Organization and sent Ronald Ngala and Tom Mboya to London as a delegation to press for an entirely new constitution one that was not only workable, but which would enable African members to accept ministerial responsibility.', 'By the end of 1959, the British Secretary of State declared an end to the State of Emergency imposed in 1952, and announced a conference to consider constitutional progress to be held in London in February 1960. Virtually the whole of the Kenya Legislative Council turned up to the first constitutional conference at Lancaster House, sitting under the chairmanship of Colonial Secretary Ian Macleod.', 'For those round-table talks, the African members of Legco had achieved an understanding with the joint delegation led by Ngala (KNP) and Mboya (KIM), in what Odinga later described as a precarious compromise.', 'The first Lancaster House conference thus resulted in a new constitution for Kenya, which came in force after the general election of February 1961. But before that could happen, the whole political process had to open to include the people. Incredibly, the African leaders had been operating all this time without the benefit of true political parties.', 'In May 1960, the first draft of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) constitution was adopted by its preparatory committees first national conference held in Kiambu. Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) would be formed soon afterwards at Ngong, as well as other parties which embarked on campaigning for the forthcoming elections.', 'On February 26 and 27, 1961, the first ever general election on a common roll was held. Over 800,000 people voted with 84 percent turnout. KANU won almost half the seats in an outright victory but refused to form a government until Kenyatta was released.', 'KADU promptly stepped in to form a government of minorities but this proved to be an uncomfortable situation. Kenyatta would be released from detention in August 1961 and was immediately elected president of KANU by early 1962, he had been elected unopposed to Legco in a by-election at Fort Hall.', 'The new Colonial Secretary, Maudling, later agreed with a Kenyattaled KANU delegation to London that a new independence constitution should be worked out in Nairobi.', 'The second Lancaster House conference started on 12 February 1962 and lasted until May. It first examined KANUs draft and then turned its attention to KADUs draft.', 'But at one point in the proceedings, Kenyatta said that the Gikuyu must be allowed to take up land in Rift Valley, at that time largely owned by Europeans where the Kikuyu were employed as farm labourers and squatters. Immediately there was a long-drawn out Aaaaah! from the Kalenjin and Maasai representatives, and Willie Murgor, from Eldoret, produced a whistle and blew a note of alarm on it, thus establishing a whistle-blowing tradition in Kenya. This caused deep suspicion on all sides.', 'Maudling finally called for a compromise plan that would include the provision of a Central Government but with the principal of regionalism incorporated in it through the establishment of six regional assemblies that would have regional administrative and financial control and executive powers over local land. ', 'All crown and trust land would be under regional control, and the scheduled land would be under a special national board. Maudling was insisting on devolved government, and since everyone wanted independence as soon as possible, KANU and KADU eventually produced a final constitution, and a Coalition Cabinet government took office in May 1962.', 'The Times of London would describe the proposed constitution as a formidable instrument of government. It was one of the most involved constitutions running to over 233 pages of checks and balances.', 'For eight million people, there were to be two central government assemblies (House of Representatives and Senate) and seven regional assemblies, separate judiciaries, police forces, and public service commissions. In essence, the independence constitution embraced the concept of devolution the same way the 2010 constitution does.', 'But all this would go down the drain soon after the May 1963 elections which KANU overwhelmingly won. With a strong mandate from the electorate, KANU went to the September constitutional conference with a draft emphasizing strong central government since KADU had no clear mandate from the people to push for the devolved system.', 'With KANU calling the shots, there were major alterations to the 1962 constitution, including the setting up of a single public service commission, instead of seven regional ones, and the establishment of a single police force under the control of Central Government.', 'The government under Prime Minister Kenyatta was also empowered to seek the support of the electorate by way of a referendum if parliament could not see its way to agree to further substantial constitutional amendments. Thus the instruments of state power were passed to the new executive, legislature, and judiciary of the newly created independent nation of Kenya, on 12 December, 1963, in a very fluid constitutional condition, under the Kenya Independence Act, 1963.', 'The devolved elements of the constitution of Kenya could only be changed legally if 75 percent of the members of both houses of parliament voted to do so. While KANU had a large majority, it did not have enough votes to change the constitution.', 'Much public political debate and private political negotiation ensured, until, on the 10 November, 1964, all the KADU members of parliament in both the House of Representatives and the Senate crossed the floor to join KANU thus forming a political monopoly that could effect constitutional change. It was quick to come.', 'The death of the devolved system of government after independence came on October 7, 1964 when Tom Mboya of KANU rose in the House of Representatives in his capacity as Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs and said;', '...so, we propose that strong national leadership be assured by election of a president who is Head of Government instead of the illusory arrangement in which you have a constitutional President and someone else as Head of Government. This arrangement is just not understood by our people, it is foreign to them. The historical process by which, in other lands, Heads of State, whether Kings or Presidents, have become figureheads are no part of our African tradition. So, in this respect, we politely reject the Westminster model. The man we choose for our president will be the leader of our nation and the leader of our government, and this, Sir, is what our people understand.', 'From that day onwards, the independence constitution was mutilated through self-serving amendments by a rubber-stamp parliament thus killing all the aspirations for good governance that Kenyans had all this was courtesy of a leadership that did not believe in devolution of power and resources taking over government.', 'With the benefit of this history, majority of Kenyans head to the March 4 polls with the understanding that that the nation has come full circle and faces the same political challenge it faced in 1963. ', 'Many will, therefore, vote wisely and voting wisely means supporting the coalition that can be trusted with the implementation of the new constitution a coalition that will not mutilate the new constitution the way those who did not believe in devolution, equity and effective representation of the people did with the independence constitution.', ' ', 'The writer is the deputy Secretary General of Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) and the Secretary General of the Muslim Leaders Forum.

Their culture involves a lot of movement in search of food and pasture and it's a matter of survival for the fittest. The disabled members of this nomadic communities suffer the most, with most of them dying young."", 'The Northern Nomadic Disabled Persons Organisation (Nondo) is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) formed by Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) from the Northern Kenya. It aims to improve the quality of life of PWD in the wider Northern Kenya, by eliminating all barriers that are hindering their full and effective participation thus giving them a platform to network, learn and have a voice.', 'It is the first organisation of its type that caters for these marginalised and voiceless group of people.', 'The executive director of the organisation, Harun Hassan said, In Somali culture if a goat is sick or has a broken leg, you slaughter it. If it wasnt for religion and the law then a disabled child would suffer the same fate. They consider such a child as stress and these children are never given the opportunity to get an education. Already with the gender issue and the low literacy levels, this child has no chance at all.', 'Northern Kenya is generally an arid and semi-arid area where rainfall is scarce and unreliable. The economic activities possible are pastoralism and small-scale retail trade. The counties of northern Kenya are ranked among the poorest in Kenya. It is isolated from the rest of the country by its lack of infrastructure.', 'Northern Kenya has all the makings of challenges for PWDs from the harsh weather, high illiteracy levels, escalating poverty to long years of marginalisation. In addition to this, many different communities-largely nomads - use the same resources of land and water. Tribal clashes, with livestock rustling and banditry, are a common occurrence in many areas.', 'Before the organisation started operating in the area, there was no plan to empower them. The culture associates disability to a bad omen. If you cannot build a Somali traditional hut or milk a camel or cook a meal, as a woman, you are disqualified as a wife. But for men, disability is only visible if you are poor. If you have a camel and some goats you can still marry. I understand that society doesnt intentionally discriminate against persons with disability but this is so because the level of awareness is low, said Hassan.', 'When families are moving from one area to another in search for pasture, the disabled are carried on the backs of donkeys or camels but in extreme circumstances where the family doesnt have enough beast of burden, they are left behind with enough food and the homestead is fenced to keep away the wild animals. When the family finally settles in the new area they go back to pick them.', 'For them, property is more valuable that humans, he said.', 'Hassan started the NGO after his own disability in March 2007. Before then, he too was oblivious to this group of people.', 'I never thought that I would ever be disabled and then I got in accident on my way to Mandera from Nairobi just as I was on the last 200km after clearing 900km. I suffered a spinal cord injury and I was paralysed from my neck down. I later regained the use of my hands. I spent a whole year in hospital.', 'Before my accident I had no interest in people with disability I never knew they even existed in the nomadic areas. That is when I started asking myself how they live here and what happens when the families start moving following the rain patterns. As a young boy I grew up herding goats and that is where the idea of starting an NGO that caters for the need of the nomadic communities sprung up.', 'I grew up in a trading centre so there was not much moving in search of pasture, he explained.', 'After the accident, Hassan had given up on life and asked to be taken to his rural home in Kutulo, Mandera.', 'There, I had decided to go and die. But once I got there, people of disability in the area came to visit me and talked to me. I accepted my condition and started getting healthy and having a better outlook of life. After this awareness, focus shifted from myself to the persons with disability in the region. I was happier. I had a purpose in life. I started Nondo, a mass movement of people with disability in North Easter areas like Mandera, Turkana, Wajir, Garissa, Marasabit, Samburu and Isiolo.', 'Nondo seeks to raise the level of awareness among PWDs, provide assistance devices-integration/participation-expensive; repairing; cost of transport and funding opportunities-poverty; awareness to access funding opportunities.', 'Hassan described the experience of working with the community.', 'I recently had a lengthy call with a mother who has a disabled child with spinal injury. I had to convince her not to keep her locked up in the house alone. I usually engage parents to bring out their children and let them be like all the other children. We have also trained parent who have children with disabilities to approach others who have not accepted their children, he said.', 'The organisation also provides education and economic empowerment.', 'Disability is only visible when you have no education. That is when we see the disabled poor and on the street begging. We have programmes on governance and urge them to participate in community affairs. There are some who told me that they do not need a national identification card because the police dont arrest them. This they dont have voters cards and dont participate actively in society.', 'Im glad that a teacher in Mandera who is a person living with disability is vying for a county representative seat.', 'I believe that when we are represented in all aspects of governance then the decisions made will have a positive trickle down effect to people with disability in far flung areas. If not we will continue struggling to ensure that we have a member in all school committees civil society, APDK and district development committees.', 'Some of the challenges that the organisation faces according to Hassan is access to the vast northern eastern region.', 'North Eastern is a vast area and efficiently penetrating it to provide services for the persons with disability is proving to be hard. There is also the issue of insecurity with the rampant rustling and banditry. The PWDs become the first casualties because they cannot run away fast enough. Some are even used as human shields.', 'Nondo, which has now been in operation for two years, was awarded the Malaika Tribute Award for Activist of the Year, which was presented by anti-jigger campaign ambassador Cecilia Mwangi during the gala dinner at Safari Park.', 'I was rude to Daddy Owen when he called me and told me I had won the award. I thought it was one of the prank calls made by conmen telling me that I had won money. But he told me to Google it to get more information about it. The award encouraged me to create awareness about disability in the context of nomadic communities in Kenya.', '\n']"

', 'They fought for land and freedom, but when these were achieved in 1963, those who had corroborated with the British colonial masters and tortured them to the limit of human endurance became the new masters as their educated children took over public and private economic sectors.', ' The uneducated freedom fighters and their children became their servants. Fifty years down the line these freedom fighters remain mortally wounded in body and soul. ', 'They lament that the African government should at least have recognised them with token pieces of land and the dignity of acknowledgement, but only the latter happened a few years ago. ', 'Below is the story of Wambui wa Mbugua who, together with her now ailing husband, was a liberation fighter who was also imprisoned for the king and country. Now approaching her 90s, Wambui has nothing to show for her labour. ', 'As the struggle for independence gained momentum and the state of emergency was declared in the early 1950s, a corroborator with the British colonialists was killed in Gatanga and a group of Mau Mau fighters operating from the Aberdare Mountains was suspected to be behind the killing. Wambuis husband was a member of this group. ', 'The colonial administration considered Wambui guilty by association and was in the process of arresting her when the information was leaked to her. On learning about her imminent arrest, Wambui fled to an adjacent village with her youngest child. ', 'There her child died of a disease she was not aware of, but she was not even able to bury him. I cannot even tell you where they buried him, as I could not leave my hiding place for fear of arrest. ', 'The colonial administration continued hunting her down and when she was informed they were hot on her heels, she decided to join her husband as a land and freedom fighter in the forest. ', 'While there, field marshal Dedan Kimathi came to our hiding place and saw me wearing a sweater he admired so much that he ordered a group of men to go back to the reserve with me to get him one just like it. ', 'So Wambui and a group of 12 men embarked on the wearisome journey from Aberdare to Gatanga to get Kimathi the coveted sweater. On arrival they were to take refuge in the house of a woman Wambui knew, but unfortunately they soon found out that the woman was a turncoat who had betrayed them to the authorities. ', 'As we approached her house through a maize plantation, we fell into an ambush in which home guards started shooting at us from all sides. Wambui was shot just below her right breast, the bullet exiting below her shoulder.', ' She carries the scars to date. Though profusely bleeding, she did not lose consciousness. After the shootout, Wambui turned to one of her team members for help as her bullet wound had drained her of her strength. ', 'Please do not leave me here; I have been wounded, she pleaded with him. The man took her to Ndunyu ya Cege in the same Gatanga region and hid her in a bush and later that night came back with others to take her back to the depth of the forest. ', 'There she struggled to stay alive for three months, nursing her wounds with lard (pig fat), a bottle of which somebody brought to her every two weeks. ', 'Living in the forest was horrific, Wambui and her colleagues constantly battled the rainy weather that left them cold and starvation was their daily companion. So compelling was it that at some stage, some of the soldiers contemplated eating one of their own for the survival of many. ', 'At one time our battalion was attacked by the colonial forces forcing us to flee in disarray to different directions. I was in a group of eight (one woman and seven men) that found itself on its own in uncharted territory with no source of food. ', 'We stayed for eight days without food and we were so hungry that my colleagues decided the only way to survive was to eat one of us and they settled on me. On the fateful day, they instructed me to go to a nearby stream to fetch water after which we lit a fire to boil it. What the water was for, I did not know. ', 'But as the water bubbled, one of my colleagues briefly went to the bush to relieve himself. By a stroke of luck, he came across a carcass of an animal that had been half eaten, probably by some wild animal. He quickly came back to the circle and told us, Forget what we have been thinking of doing - come let us pick a dead animal I have just seen. ', 'The men picked themselves slowly, dragged the carcass back to the fire and it was sliced piece by piece and thrown into the boiling water. As the fighters feasted on the animal they revealed to Wambui that were it not for the miracle of the dead animal, she would have been the extensive meal they were enjoying that night. ', 'We had decided that we would start eating each other as we did not have an alternative and you were to be the first victim, they confessed. To date Wambui does not begrudge them. ', 'During the interview she also talked of one of her colleagues who for months survived on monkey meat. The man had been severely injured in battle and when his battalion scattered, he found himself alone and unable to move.', ' He would later tell us how he positioned himself quietly under a sloping bamboo and waited until a monkey came walking along. When it was directly above him, he would club the unsuspecting animal to the ground and skin it with a razor blade. That and a box of matches were his survival tools for the three months, before he was rescued. ', 'Unlike those who were detained, imprisoned or employed by the settlers for slave wages, Wambui says nobody tortured the freedom fighters. However once they were attacked by the much better armed colonial forces, many of them died or were left wounded without the benefit of medicine. ', 'When she came out of the forest (she cannot remember the year), she went to a man known as Caragu in Murangas Location Four who got her a job as a coffee picker in a nearby colonial farm. There she stayed with her brother-in-law and his family, before she was betrayed by the turncoats and the authorities came for her. ', 'The white man, who was in charge of torturing our people at Kagaa in Location One, came for me at the coffee farm, but he could barely approach me fearing I had a gun and would shoot. I was arrested eventually and taken to Kagaa where they interrogated and mercilessly tortured me physically for days on end. ', 'The white officers even took me to the Aberdare forest insisting that I show them where the other freedom fighters were hiding, but when I adamantly denied any knowledge of their whereabouts, they beat me to the point of death. So badly was she beaten that the same officer who had arrested her had to take her to Muranga hospital where she was treated for two weeks. ', 'When her brother-in-law found out she had been arrested, he vowed to never tell anyone about her arrest and neither did he want to see her after the torture. He locked himself in the house and committed suicide. Wambui only found about the suicide when she came back from detention. ', 'She was detained at Kamiti Maximum Prison where the prisoners were served morsels that barely kept them alive. They served us bites of porridge and ugali with a very small bowl which we called bite. At times they served us boiled potatoes but most of these had been exposed to the sun and were rotten. These potatoes were served with raw animal fat as was the ugali. ', 'So disgusting was the rotten boiled potatoes that Wambui stopped eating potatoes when she was released from prison. She has not eaten them since.', 'Apart from the little food rations, the prisoners were constantly beaten and teased by their fellow African sisters who had been employed as guards. They were Kenyans like the rest of us, but these were horrible women; very bad people.', 'Unknown to her, while Wambui was serving time in prison, so was her husband who was captured soon after her arrest. He was detained at Hola and because of the torture he endured, he suffered a stroke and can now barely walk.', 'We went to the forest to fight for our dignity and we were treated as rubbish by the white man and the Indians. We also fought for independence and the return of our land which had been taken by the white man and his home guards.', 'But 50 years down the line, we have not got our land back, we still hear our people glorifying the white man and his ways, the Indian still shouts at the African and the government has not shown its gratitude to those who fought for the liberation of this country. There will be no Jubilee celebrations for us.', ' ', ' ', '\n']"

She also wrenches the Mogadishu narrative away from what she calls The Black Hawk Down Syndrome, whereby descriptions of the city as the world capital of things-gone-completely-to-hell... ravaged by some fatal urban disease would inform all discourse on Mogadishu and Somalia from then on.

Once she is in power she is going to be mean and dictatorial in her own right.', 'You rightly said thats the detractors script. African prints are part of us, these are things I have worn ever since I entered the campaign trail in 1992. Maybe not all the time but those who remember me know that I always have campaigned in African prints and that in 2003 when we entered government, it was my main attire. I have come back to it, I am seeking the top position of this country. I want my identity as an African woman, as an African leading an African nation. And about going to studios, dance is part of our culture; my campaign is always song and dance, so the public may not have seen me dancing because the scenes that are taken to them by the media will be parliament, taking tough stand...', 'A different side of you therefore?', 'Yes a different side of me.', 'Are you softening your image because the image makers have convinced you to be nice?', 'My image has not been softened, it is just that the public has been able to see another side of me. Every one of us has different faces. I am sure when you are angry, real angry, you do not look the way you look today. When you are happy, completely happy, its visible. I am a human being just like the rest.', 'I will go now to the idea of those who say the only real way to see your campaign is just in a pioneering row, in an educational row but in reality you do not really have a chance because you are a woman. And Kenyan society is a misogynistic society. You have a wonderful detail, you probably got wonderful security, you have been a government minister for years and years but we remember a woman politician and the story of her on the campaign trail being beaten to a pulp, forced to smear herself with her own excrement as a symbol of the way the electorate felt about her, so with all these poor ratings in the polls who do you presume will be your electorate?', 'May I first begin by saying that those are the exact words the detractors told me in 1992 when as a youth I decided to vie for the Gichugu seat. Its just so surprising that the script of detractors doesnt change it is the same...it is same script 20 years later. Just like I said in 1992 to the detractors, let that be your worry I will keep to my campaign, I will keep to the issues am speaking to. The electorate is not made entirely by detractors, its made of people who listen, who make value judgment based on what they see on their interaction. My duty is to interact with as many Kenyans as possible and I have done that by traversing all the counties of Kenya not once, not twice.', 'And I am saying all very honourable that come the big day there is this idea of the two-horse race.', 'I am going to shock you, I am going to shock all the detractors by emerging victorious.', 'You once said, I am running for president of Kenya to defend the constitution as a frame work of that hope that guarantees all Kenyans a life, of dignity and equality to restore faith in our public service and institutions, and to inspire each one of us to play our role in the pursuit of the promise of a greater Kenya. Wonderful inspiring Martin Luther King maybe Barack Obama but the constitution is a bit of paper which we are already beginning to savage even before you become president.', 'That is why the country needs a different grid of leadership. I will not treat the covenant with the people as a piece of paper. It is the leaders and the people who must breathe life into that document by living it, by implementing it to the letter, and that is my promise to the people of Kenya. That is the document that we bind ourselves with so that we can respect each others right so that we can give each other space to thrive. That is a document we must honour if we are to realise a greater Kenya.', 'Miss Karua if I were a Christian I would say that the Bible is the document by which we ought to live by, if I were a Hindu I would say the Gita, if I were a Muslim I would say the Quran and we see many of you politicians, on weekly basis on the ritual of going to pray and seek supplication from the higher authority. Yet in all these years Christianity has not bound, Islam has not bound, Hinduism has not bound the conduct of Kenyans. So therefore again I am going to say all very well and good the constitution, why should the constitution guide Kenyans to a much greater degree than the Bible? We have presidents who have gone to mars and presidents who have gone to church every single Sunday and still managed to pin the economy.', 'I think John, you are dwelling on the failings of human beings, the fact that we are gullible does not mean that we cease trying, otherwise we would have stopped exsisting. Why we exist is that we have hope of a better tomorrow and we do our best. Even in membership clubs you are thrown out when you dont obey the rules, their has to be something regulating our relationship within the society. Our relationship is with those we have asked to govern the society, and the constitution is that regulatory framework.', 'We must obey it and there are sanctions for not obeying it and all that is required is to the best of our ability and when you fall short you are sanctioned by the same documents. So I do not think that even in religion a Christian will say that because I am human, I am gullible, I better not believe in anything. I do not think that is the way to go. In a country will be calling of anarchy and we have seen the sort of thing that is happening in this country today-deterioration of security, public services, because they are affected by corruption and impunity and am urging people of this country, the voters, to identify like I have, corruption and impunity as the greatest threat to the nation of Kenya and its citizens. And I pledge to deal with this decisively using our constitution, so that we can be able to enjoy a civil society, a country where we can thrive.', 'It seems to me that your resolution has to do with the top-down mechanism, the leaders will tell us what to do. Now I seem to think that it was meant to be grassroots bottom-up that made societies better. Again to go to the American sort of thing we have two sort of polarised people. You have dyed-in- the-wool capitalists, and you have dyed- in-the-wool socialists. They sort of yo-yo between socialist policies Republican versus Democrats, Labour versus the Conservatives. Is there a parallel to that kind of equilibrium in the Kenyan society under you by definition of capitalists or socialists...', 'To begin with, you cannot say that it is a top-down approach. The constitution is not the document of leaders, it is a document negotiated, voted for by Kenyans. The Kenyan individual and the Kenyan citizens can be able to give direction to their leader through that negotiated document, so thats a bottom-up approach where the people are supreme and thats what our constitution says. I am more towards the socialists.', 'But that would be an insult anywhere else in the world. If you dared say socialist you wouldnt be elected in the US for example...', 'It doesnt matter, everywhere even the diehard capitalists are now speaking socialist. I went to a convention in Europe, they are talking of social market economy. Before they have been talking of market economy now they have made it social why? Even the capitalists are realising that you cannot have a system that does not reach out to the vulnerable.', 'Miss Karua, I am still on this tangent. We are going back to this idea of our history and I remember the reference to Sessional Paper Number 10 charted a path that Kenya was trying to lead and has led us to our present condition. Under your leadership, under your government are you going to undo the rapid acquisition of wealth that has dominated the first 50 years of our existence?', 'I dont think so, we are not undoing any acquisition of wealth. It is just making people respect public property.', 'Those who have wealth will see you as an enemy and they will direct their money as they did for the Republican candidates in the election if you followed.', 'And they failed and they will fail even here. What I am saying is this that even for those who have wealth need an orderly system, need a system where their wealth can even thrive further. So having an orderly society is for everybody. You dont want to have your business robbed.', 'At what point are you going to streamline the world greatest millionaire ... to say cut down on your profits because... or tax them to a point where you build roads, they are going to say my profit margin is a...', 'Arent we doing it right here? How do we get taxes? We are trying to make it as though there is a new system that is being brought. Its order and proper management thats what good governance is all about. Management, how do we manage our common wealth, our public resources? I wont care how you manage your resources but I will care about how we manage our common wealth, are we using it to the benefit of all Kenyans? I want to see better health services and thats why I am talking about universal health care, enough public facilities. The wealthy can continue going to the private hospitals but that person who has no other alternative needs access to health. We are talking of universal education from primary to secondary level, so that my child just like the child of any other Kenyan irrespective of their financial situation, is able to access quality education. We are talking of quality university education, we are not talking of free university education but a system closer to what was there when I went to Nairobi University. When I could get accommodation,tuition and meals. That equalises the child of the poor and the child of the rich. We are talking about having better security, having support to our medium and small enterprises to create jobs.', 'When you say things like having better security, it seems to me like the reason we have the security situation as it is that basically we dont secure our borders.', 'It is, in this day and age we cannot be policing our borders...', 'Miss Karua if I were Somalia and wanted to end up in Somalia now I dont see why that should be a big problem if I looked like everybody else on the other side of the border. Unless you are going have in your government a great sort of immigration thing like Israel or a wall...', 'What I am trying to say is that you cannot be policing our borders without technology in this day and age.', 'It all speaks to money, you are trying to suggest that there is money in government...', 'Precisely, which goes away with the corrupt, we are losing 1/3 by Treasurys own admission, 1/3 of the budget goes to corruption and other bills.', 'So how will you deal with the corrupt? And will the policemen under your government all of a sudden cease taking bribes because its president Karua who is in and we love her so much so we wont take a bribe? I am telling you to be someone realistic... what are you going to do?', 'If the world was full of pessimists who hold the view you are marketing today, then there would be no world. The fact that so many people are doing wrong things doesnt mean we stop trying. Once we hold everyone to account, that policeman who lets a person come through the border with contraband, we punish them they lose their job or get any other penalty under the law. What is killing Kenya is impunity.', 'Tell us how we should recreate economy.', 'We can see our economy thriving but we need to fight corruption and impunity to enjoy this potential that is being unleashed. And it is your responsibility, my responsibility as voters to usher in a government that can decisively fight corruption and impunity and put the interest of Kenyans first and that team leader is me.', '\n']"

They consider them flawless, that they never err and should they do anything wrong, their positions in society put them above criticism. But to understand the right of the media to criticise leaders, let me cite five main functions of any radio station.', 'Medias first responsibility is to inform their audiences or readership of whatever is happening in the country, good or bad. But in informing people of whatever they must observe fidelity to truth, however painful. But the pain of truth is like the pain of giving birth. It has sweet consequences. ', 'The second function of media is to educate its readership or audience on the many things in the world whose existence they dont know and if they do, they dont understand.', 'The third function of a radio station is to criticise society and leadership when they get lost. To do this, many radio stations allow their radios to serve as platforms for self-criticism or criticism of leaders. When society rejects self-criticism or criticism, it is like a human being that will not bathe. It stinks.', 'The forth function of a radio or television station is to entertain its audience with music, films, plays or narration of stories. In entertaining however, every station must not undermine by violating its dos and donts in order to undermine its culture or morally pervert its youth by exposing them to things that corrupt their behaviour and character. Media should therefore not promote pornography.', 'The fifth function of the media is to engage in advertising business selling its airtime as a commercial enterprise. But this business must be conducted through obedience to laws like the Public Procurement and Disposal Act. ', 'Nor should media use falsehood to promote profits. Since media are the ultimate critics, they should avoid corruption when they may not self-criticise.', 'In the days of one party dictatorship, people could not criticise leaders even if they walked naked in the market by denying them the right to use a government radio station like KBC whose only work was to praise the president, entertain him, spread his propaganda and broadcast news about him only. All news that the government media broadcast was to praise the president while denigrating and demonising political enemies.', 'Under Kenyatta, every KBC reporter who dared criticise the president would be taught a lesson while all people including KBC were all the time advised to chorus the presidents song like a parrot or risk being detained without trial.', 'Courtesy of our new constitution and democracy, a private radio station has a right to criticise any leader who does wrong but as the musician Munish will say, it is the right of those who listen to a radio not to listen to that criticism if it grates their ears.', 'In offering criticism to society, a radio station must not discriminate. It must not have those it will criticise with alacrity and sacred cows whom it will never criticise. ', 'When a radio criticises Kibaki, it should also criticise Raila, and when it criticises Uhuru, it must also criticise Kalonzo Musyoka. As the saying goes, media must not have some of the stomach and others of the back.', 'Here we need to understand that according to democracy, the job of criticising leaders, exposing their weakness and mistakes to avoid their recurrence, belongs to media as its way of protecting people from leaders who are inclined to oppression and other evils just because they have the power to oppress. Indeed, media should be regarded as enemies of society if they should shy to criticise leaders out of love or fear.', 'In its criticism of leaders or its education of people, there are certain things a radio may not do deliberately.', 'First, where it criticises all human deities, it may not criticise God.', 'Second, criticising a radio station will ensure it does so with responsibility, making sure it puts public interests and truth before everything else. ', 'Equally, when a radio station criticises a leader, it must ensure it does not violate his rights. It must also give a right of reply to all those who think they have been criticised unfairly. Criticism of a radio must also go along with readiness to give credit where due.', 'It must also be understood that to criticise deeds, policies, utterances and works of a leader does not amount to attacking the person. Unfortunately many dont understand this.', 'A leader who is above criticism is a dictator and people who protect such leaders from criticism aid and abet dictatorship even when they are its victims.', 'Unfortunately, dictatorship has a tendency to keep people as slaves who dont know of their rights and spend all their time defending dictators who the primary source of their problems.', 'Worse, when tyranny is constructed, common people forget about their interests. They only think of the interests of their leader. And for fear of dictatorship, poor people never dare utter a word about their problems. When the leader catches a cold, they sneeze.', 'During elections, poor people have no agenda. To them, the agenda of leaders is the agenda of elections. In fact it saddens that when people talk during elections, they hardly mention problems they want solved after elections.', 'Ultimately the freedom of expression is the freedom to criticize leaders and government. When people surrender this freedom, they deny themselves democracy and commit suicide. But a society without a voice is a slave society that must be liberated.

This is a result of numerous disputes that resulted in mass defections to other Cord-affiliated parties after the shambolic nomination process.', 'Unlike before when nominations in Nyanza determined who would win in the general election, this time round no one can tell with certainty who will emerge as a winner come March 4.', 'ODM leader Prime Minister Raila Odinga recently criss-crossed the region in a bid to convince the electorate to vote for him.', 'On Monday, Cord Effect Team, a lobby group campaigning for the PM went to Kisumu and told residents that they were only campaigning for the PM and were not interested in who becomes the MP or county representative so long as they were from the Cord-affiliated parties.', 'Ababu Namwamba led the team that comprised, John Kiarie, Mumbi Ngaru, Nancy Abisai, Joyce Lei and Rosa Buyu. Siaya county is one of the areas where ODM governor aspirant Cornel Rasanga Amoth is expected to face stiff competition from William Oduol, who is running for the seat on a National Agenda Party of Kenya ticket.', 'Oduol, PM Railas brother Oburu Ogingas challenger during the recent party primaries decamped to NAPK after they were both disqualified by ODM following a dispute as to who won the nomination. The party decided to hand the nomination certificate to Amoth.', ""Former Alego Usonga MP Sammy Weya who will be vying for the area's parliamentary seat on a NAPK ticket expressed optimism that they will carry the day after Amoth picked little known Bondo parliamentary seat loser Ouma Onyango as his running mate."", 'Onyango was Oburus preferred candidate for the Bondo parliamentary seat but was trounced by Gideon Ochanda who had earlier declared interest for governor but later pulled out to run for Bondo MP.', 'We have no problem with Raila Odinga\'s presidency. We will campaign for him but what we are calling for is respect for multi-party democracy. We must not put all our eggs in one basket. We must be ready to elect development-conscious and progressive leaders and desist from the culture of voting for people basing on the political parties they belong to,"" Weya said.', 'He called on the public to fully support the ODM candidates who won their nominations fairly.', '""The people who must be rejected are those who were handed nomination certificates unfairly after being trounced. This is not the democracy the PM has been preaching. Before the sham primaries, the PM promised to work with whoever the people elected. He must now be ready to work with any candidate regardless of his or her political party after the elections, Weya said.', 'But Lands minister James Orengo is of a different opinion. He has warned that rival political parties have infiltrated ODM strong zones to scuttle Prime Minister Raila Odingas presidential bid. Orengo asked voters to be wary of newly-formed parties especially in Nyanza purporting to support Raila yet they are ""agents of doom"".', ""Wary of Oduols immense influence in Siaya county, Orengo said a Raila government requires trusted lieutenants not gullible leaders who will be swayed by money to betray its course. He asked voters in Siaya to elect a governor who will work in harmony with Raila's government in delivering services to wananchi."", 'Immigration Minister Otieno Kajwang is also expected to face stiff competition from PDPs Hilary Alila. Alila expressed optimism he will trounce the former Mbita MP on March 4. ', 'We want our people to elect development-conscious leaders and not mere party soloists who do not have the interest of their people at heart, Alila said.', ""It will also be tricky for Wilfred Machage of ODM who is said to have lost in the ODM primaries to former Migori county ODM chairman John Magaiwa in the senator's race. Machage will battle it out with independent candidate Oluoch Kanindo. "", 'During the ODM primaries, majority of members of the Luo community voted for Magaiwa who hails from Kuria but the certificate was issued to Machage.', 'In Muhoroni constituency, outgoing MP Ayiecho Olweny is facing major hurdles in his bid to recapture the seat. Olweny will not have it easy after James Onyango Koyoo defected to Magaras Peoples Democratic Party citing unfairness in the ODM primaries.', 'The people of Muhoroni made the right choice by voting for me but it is unfortunate the ODM certificate was handed to Olweny. However, I am ready to give him a run for his money while campaigning for the PM, Koyoo said.', ""In Kisumu Central constituency, ODM's Ken Obura is facing stiff competition from businessman Abdulqadir Omar of Ford-Kenya. Omar decamped from ODM citing irregularities in the party primaries."", 'I tried to step down for Obura but my supporters would hear none of it. I am now fully in the race after being cleared to run on a Ford-Kenya party ticket, Omar said.', 'Other constituencies where ODM will face competition include Gem, Alego Usonga, Nyando, Karachuonyo and Uriri. In Gem, Federal Party of Kenyas Elisha Odhiambo Akubah who was declared winner against former MP Jakoyo Midiwo in the ODM primaries but the nomination certificate given to his rival and Booker Omole of Social Democratic Party (SDP) have vowed to teach Midiwo a lesson.', 'In Alego Usonga, outgoing MP Edwin Yinda will battle it out with Wiper Democratic Partys (WDP) Omondi Mulwan. Former Nyando MP Fred Outa will also fight it out with Ford-Kenyas Jared Okello. Former Karachuonyo MP James Rege will fight it out with Wipers Adipo Okuome who claims to have won the ODM primaries.', 'In Uriri constituency, former MP Ojwang Omollo who defected to Ford Kenya after being denied the ODM certificate has promised a bruising battle against his opponent Enock Kobado. Former Kisumu Town West MP Olago Aluoch defected to Ford-Kenya after being trounced by Rosa Buyu. ', 'Buyu beat Olago in a fair nomination contest. In 2007, Olago was declared winner in a shambolic nomination. This time round, Buyus supporters have expressed confidence she will beat Olago.', 'Those who defected to other parties affiliated to Cord have accused ODM of being insincere to its partners by terming them projects in their campaigns. They are now seeking the intervention of their party bosses to ensure a level playing ground with their ODM competitors.', 'Pastor George Weda who is running for Kisumu senator on the Farmers Party ticket faulted calls by some aspirants for ""six-piece"" voting saying this will affect democracy in the region.', 'The six-piece calls may lead to voter apathy that will also affect the PMs votes in the region hence it must be shunned, he said. Weda warned that if the PM comes out openly to campaign for his ODM candidates, it will lead to suspicion among Cord coalition partners that may threaten their unity.', 'It is this kind of suspicion that can even lead to Cord breaking just like the Pentagon team of 2007, he added. Weda promised to give ODM candidate for the Kisumu senate seat Anyang Nyongo a run for his money.', '\n']"

But his millions of supporters in and beyond Nyanza very strongly reject being told to support specific candidates, including manifest non-performers and perceived political pests who left the Civil Service or were in Parliament only the other day. The people clearly want to make their own choices at the grassroots.', ' ', 'This brings us to the biggest blunders that Raila has made in this regard outside Luo Nyanza in totally ill-advised moves that are quietly building up such resentment and perceptions of maximum disrespect that his preferred candidates are heading straight for humiliating defeat. ', ' ', 'On Tuesday, January 15, 2013, three days before the initial Independent Elections and Boundaries Commissions (IEBC) deadline for the all-party nominations, Raila travelled to Kakamega and endorsed his second co-principal in Cord, Trade Minister Moses Wetangula, for senator, a gesture that went down very well with the electorate as it was taken as a salute and a show of respect for his coalition partner. However, in the very same breath, the PM also endorsed an assistant minister in his office, Alfred Khangati, for governor of Bungoma, an ODM candidate.', ' ', 'The Khangati endorsement was instantly and widely viewed as a slap in the face and a kick in the teeth for Wetangula, given the fact that Ford Kenya has a very substantial candidate for governor of Bungoma in Ambassador Jack Tumwa. Where else will Wetangula, Ford-K and ourselves get a governor if the PM imposes Khangati? is a lament that has been heard throughout Bungoma and its diasporas, both inside and outside Kenya, since then.', ' ', 'Reports this week to the effect that Khangati has actually quit the race, citing lack of funding, and communicated this momentous decision to the PM by SMS and by letter to the IEBC returning officer in Bungoma, were instantly taken by the electorate to be insufficient to remove the disrespect to Wetangula occasioned by the initial endorsement at Kakamega. The mood on the ground is that the PM should revisit the region and acknowledge Tumwas bid.', ' ', 'In Ukambani in late December, the PMs wife, Ida Anyango Odinga, endorsed the assistant minister in charge of Youth Affairs in the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Wavinya Ndeti, for governor of Machakos county. ', 'Mrs Odinga and her advisers did not pause for one moment and ask themselves how this maximum disrespect of the second Cord principal, Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka, whose Wiper party already had former government spokesman Dr Alfred Mutua as gubernatorial candidate, would go down in Ukambani. She said Ndeti had done a sterling job as Kathiani MP.', ' ', 'Mrs Odinga did not stop there in her endorsement sprees. At the end of 2012, she endorsed Minister of State for National Heritage & Culture William Ntimamas daughter, Lydia Masikonde, an ODM candidate, for the women representative in Narok county.', ' ', 'What on earth has possessed the PM and his wife and made them so insensitive not only to their own grassroots at home but also to his co-principals in Cord? This is a case both of bad strategy and the worst possible political timing. ', ' ', 'But while there has been no booing in Bungoma and Machakos, the people of these places are no different from the people of Migori, Siaya and Homa Bay. They are willing to support the PM and Cord to the last man and woman, but he must allow them to exercise their choice for the other five elective seats on the ballot.', ' ', 'Raila is in a very tight place barely a month before the General Election. He needs everyone. Above all, he cannot afford to lose viable candidates or to step so wantonly on his co-principals toes.

The next time they revisit the scenes of their deeply unpopular endorsements, they must apologise and make amends.', '\n']"

He has handily won two classic presidential contests (2008 and 2012) and has since 2004 delivered a series of what are clearly the American political speeches of the 21st Century thus far.', 'On Tuesday this week, President Barack Obama made an extraordinary gesture full of far-reaching implications  he addressed a YouTube video message to the people of Kenya on the occasion of their forthcoming 11th General Election.', 'All of Kenya sat up and paid maximum attention, including reading between the lines and divining subtle signals of a political, diplomatic, international peace and security nature.', 'Though he botched his Kiswahili greetings, saluting Kenyans everywhere as Habari Yako instead of Habari Yenu, Obama made a number of powerful advisory points. It was a carefully crafted message, well aware of Kenyas multiple presidential candidates, party loyalties and deep divides.', 'The oratory and sense of occasion were much in evidence: You can show the world you are not just a member of a tribe or ethnic group but citizens of a great and proud nation. I cannot imagine a better way to mark the 50th anniversary of Kenyas Independence.', 'Whether Prime Minister Raila Odinga or Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta wins the presidential race, either and his supporters will claim Obamas remarks as significantly prefatory to their victory.', 'Obamas message, touching as it did on the two scheduled apex political events of 2013 in Kenya, the polls and the Golden Jubilee of Independence, means all things to all sides of the Kenyan political divide. Indeed, the Jubilee Coalition presidential pair of Uhuru and William Ruto were among the first politicians to salute the Obama message, clearly relieved that it neither expressed a political preference nor deplored their status as crimes-against-humanity suspects with cases to answer at the International Criminal Court at The Hague. ', 'All Obama said was that if the elections are credible, if the elections were credible, you will continue to have a strong friend and partner in the United States of America.', 'And Obamas message was unique  he has not dispensed such country and event-specific good advice to any other nation on his presidential watch so far. It was a message to the people of the land of his forefathers, a country from which he is only one generation removed.', 'But the most significant aspect of the message to Kenya is the impression that, this time, the world is really watching, is all eyes and ears, monitoring every step of the way towards Kenyas next presidential polls, the first since the disputed results of the 2007 poll that led straightaway to the post-election violence in which 1,300 died, 650,000 were displaced and the economy almost went into a tailspin, falling from an impressive 7% growth to below 4%.', 'Kenyans have held a national electoral event after the trauma of the PEV, the National Referendum on the new Constitution in August 2010, which went off without a hitch and to world-class standards rarely witnessed in Africa.', ' But a national plebiscite, with its starkly simple Black and White, Yes and No choice, is a much less complex affair than the forthcoming biggest and most complicated General Election of them all, an event that is likely to generate all manner of disputes and counter-claims.', 'As for dispute resolution, Obama advised Kenyans, Kenya must reject intimidation and violence, and allow a free and fair vote. Kenyans must resolve disputes in the courts, not in the streets.', 'The kind of scrutiny that the Obama Administration is bringing to bear on the Kenyan General Election is unprecedented and the top members of the political class and their strategists, whether outgoing or incoming, educated in America or not, will be forgiven for feeling more self-conscious than usual.', 'For millions of Kenyans, particularly prospective voters in the hotspots of 2007, this is no bad thing. In fact, the message should also have been broadcast on radio in its entirety, given the fact that the vast majority of Kenyans outside the ruling and middle classes and the far-flung Diaspora are not users of YouTube, but they do listen to FM radio keenly and broadcasting has a 24/7 cycle inside Kenya, including in Kiswahili and a large variety of the 42 vernacular languages and their dialects.', 'The US Presidents gesture places Kenya very high up on the list of his second-term foreign policy priorities. And it will almost certainly be followed by another key message in the aftermath of the 11th General Election. ', '\n']"

In his case the irony is that those who strive for social justice put their lives at greater risk than those who work to deprive others of their rights.', 'On that December evening unidentified assailants hurled a hand grenade at Hassan as he emerged from a mosque in Kamukunji constituency for which he is seeking re-election on March 4. Five people died in the attack and several others were injured, including Hassan who sustained fractures in his legs.', 'As further part of lifes irony, the horrific incident occurred just outside of Hidaya Mosque, as a crowd of worshipers dispersed from the evening prayers. ', 'Hassan has just greeted and lectured the small crowd on politics and what needs to be done in Kamukunji when the grenade was thrown at them.', ' I heard a crack; something like someone throwing a stone on one of the roofs, and then there was a bit of smoke and a flash; and a sound like gunfire.', ' Immediately, in front of me I could see its impact. There was a delay before I was hit and the people who were standing in front of me bore the brunt of it. ', 'Two youngsters were lifted off the ground. I tried to react before realising that I had been hit on both legs badly, Hassan says. Five people died in the attack and several others were injured. Hassan sustained serious fractures in his legs, needing surgery to implant steel rods in both.', ' On one [leg] almost all the muscle and tendons were torn apart and fell on the floor. People were screaming all over, lying on the ground and that is all I can remember, he says.', 'Nonetheless, Hassan remains philosophical about the assassination attempt. He touchingly says that the attack has humbled him and brought him closer to his family. ', 'It clearly shows how fragile we are as human beings. How life is short and how important it is to use the little time we have on earth to make a difference, to make a contribution and change society. It also tells me that I should spend more time with my family and those who are close to me, he said.', ' Looking back, the tall, suave and highly articulate Hassan says: I had no fear whatsoever that my life would be in danger for the simple fact that I had gone into politics to try help make a difference. I didnt imagine anyone would want to end my life.', 'Such a view could be seen as naive considering Kenyas perilous politics but then Hassan is a person whose trust in the decency of Kenyans is deep-rooted. ', 'In his heyday, he was known as a political firebrand, a constant thorn in the establishment which at one point confiscated his passport. Some would argue that he has now joined the same establishment he was fighting against and so has effectively sold out.', 'The African struggle', 'Hassan disagrees. He says there have been three phases in the African struggle towards freedom and each required different means. The first was the fight against colonial rule, which in Kenyas case could only best be tackled through an armed struggle, as pioneered by the Mau Mau Kenyan Land and Freedom Movement. ', 'The second was the battle against a dictatorial one-party system that could only effectively be challenged by the kind of firebrand activism for which he was famous.', 'He becomes animated when he reminisces about his life as an activist with movements such as the old Ukenya organisation, which was banned in Kenya and which he had chaired while in exile in London during the Moi era. ', 'Other Ukenya activists included Kenyas best known novelist Ngugi wa Thiongo and the countrys foremost Swahili poet Abdilatif Abdalla as well as the lawyer and former MP Wanyiri Kihoro and his late wife Wanjiru Kihoro.', 'Then Kenya lived in the dark age of a dictatorial one-party system and Hassan proudly says that Ukenya fought for the right to vote, the right to a multi-party system and the right to freedom of speech. Rights that are now all part of our constitution.', 'However, in spite of the achievements so far Hassan is keen to stress that Kenya still has some way to go before becoming a fully-fledged democratic state. ', 'Democracy is not merely to have the right to elect a member of parliament or to have periodic elections, he says. Democracy must also mean the right to clean water, the right to shelter, the right to human security and the protection of human dignity and the human being. For me democracy is much broader, he adds.', 'However, Hassan says that with the reintroduction of multi-party politics and with its new constitution Kenya is now in its third phase  fighting for social justice, equity and developing an immature democracy. ', 'He believes the current struggle is best waged from within the establishment. You cannot achieve change in isolation. Ive said that Im not going to be a spectator; Im going to be an active participant in the struggle for change in my community and country. And Im satisfied to an extent that in the short period Ive been in parliament, Ive been able to do that, he says.', 'Even his political rivals agree that Hassan has positively changed Kamukunji during his brief time in Parliament. Hassan himself cites the bursaries he handed out to 3,500 deprived children of Kamukunji as his proudest achievement as MP. ', 'He is also credited with the 21 roads that have been built in the area during this period. Some of these roads link up to the city centre and have already contributed much in improving commerce in the bustling neighbourhood. Thus Eastleighs commercial hub now sees thousands of visitors daily, a feat that was previously impossible due to lack of access.', 'Regeneration', 'Business revival and the regeneration of Kamukunji as a whole is a singular achievement also noted by Hassan. He mentions the rejuvenation of Kamukunjis Kikomba market, the second largest second hand clothing market in Eastern and Central Africa, as well as the Burma meat market in Shauri Moyo which the government had shut down last May citing its unhygienic conditions.', 'All these places are seeing regeneration. Were doing quite a lot of rebuilding and reconstruction. Im confident that if Im given more time [as an MP], well be able to  brick by brick  build the whole of Kamukunji, so that well have a cleaner, healthier, safer and better Kamukunji, he says.', 'Improvements have also been made to the sanitation and health of Kamukunjis residents. Whereas previously sewage systems in the areas slums were non-existent or blocked, significant rejuvenation of the sewage networks have reduced urban environmental diseases that are unique to third-world cities like Nairobi.', 'The electrification of Kamukunji is another of Hassans achievement. Before his election as an MP certain parts of Eastland were in complete darkness.', ' These areas are now lit with security lights and street lights, improving safety levels and increasing trading at night. Despite being a victim of an assassination attempt and the numerous bomb explosions in Eastleigh, Hassan surprisingly looks as effervescent as ever. He credits the Kenyan people for his buoyancy and confidence.', 'The majority of Kenyans are hardworking, upright, in want of good leadership and a prosperous country that is moving forward and theyre willing to work across ethnic and religious lines. I think my optimism is built on that particular group of people of Kenyans who will move in the right direction when this country needs to change, he says.', 'The escalating violence in Tana River, along with the ongoing conflicts in Baragoi and North Eastern Kenya bring back sour memories to Hassan.', ' War scarred his fondest childhood memories. An ethnic Somali born in Nairobi to an itinerant trader father, Hassan recounts his travel to Garissa as a boy to learn Quran. Living in Tana River he found himself among a rich diversity of plants and wildlife, including elephants, hyenas, lions and crocodiles.', 'We spent a lot of time poking fun and throwing stones at the crocodiles, particularly when they came out into the sun; it was almost like they were tourists coming out to soak the sun. We had a lot of fun playing around with them during the periods that we were out of school. That was one of the earliest memories that I have of who I am and being at peace with the natural habitat, he says.', 'Shifta war', 'The so-called Shifta War of 1963 to 1967 in North Eastern Kenya and Garissa in particular sadly cut short the halcyon days of his childhood. ', 'Instead, his idyllic experience was quickly followed by his most harrowing early memory. This was a very tragic time in the history of our community. ', 'Thousands of our people were killed, thousands were injured and thousands of others were displaced as refugees both internally and in the neighbouring countries. That is probably the most traumatising and tragic memory that I have. I lost many of my beloved relatives, sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunties, and there are some who we do not even know if theyre still alive or not because theyve fled the conflict and have not returned, Hassan says.', 'The experience, he says, later made him empathise with the displaced people of the Rift Valley. But he accuses the current Kenyan government and its predecessors of failing to address the countrys previous wars. ', 'The issues of many of the victims of the Mau Mau struggle and many of the victims of the Shifta War have not been resolved. There have been no post-mortems and there has been no attempt to empathise with the people who have suffered horrendously during these cruel, terrible wars in our country, he says.', 'Kamukunji residents turned up in their thousands during the TNA party elections to vote for Hassan as their parliamentary candidate while he lay in his hospital bed recovering from grenade attack injuries', '. Im thankful to the people of Kamukunji for showing me their humanity. Ive received thousands and thousands of messages of solidarity wishing me well. ', 'I have been touched by the feelings of these thousands of Kenyans of different ethnic groups, different religious groups and different backgrounds. They have really given me a lot of courage and energy.', 'He is confident that on March 4,they will return him to Parliament with an overwhelming majority of votes as they did in the previous poll.', '\n']"

', ' Done between August and December last year, the report says communities all over the Rift are saying : This time we wont be unprepared. ', ' Unlike 2007-2008 when both sides used machetes, spears, bows and arrows, Kalenjin and Kikuyu elders, as well as local government officials, told Human Rights Watch that both communities have now acquired guns, the report says. ', ' The report says that the underlying causes of the 2008 violence remain in place and in some parts of the country the tensions have escalated. ', ' It says a combination of inaction by the authorities in some regions and abusive or discriminatory conduct in others, plus a failure to implement promised reform, have worsened the situation. ', ' The report says since last year, 477 Kenyans have lost their lives in inter-communal clashes in various parts of the country. Another 118,000 people have been displaced. ', ' The common theme, however, is the unwillingness of the government and other state authorities since the post-election violence of 2007-2008 to address the root causes of violence, reform the police, tackle official corruption, disband criminal groups, resettle displaced persons and hold accountable the many perpetrators of violence, it says. ', ' In Coast, the report says the grievances of Mombasa Republican Council have simply been swept under the carpet. ', ' In Nyanza and Central, powerful criminal groups and armed gangs are backing politicians. In North Eastern, security forces have stoked tensions by using excessive force against local residents, especially after attacks by armed groups on the police and military. ', ' The report says the the Jubilee presidential ticket of Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto- two of the four Kenyans facing crimes against humanity charges at the ICC, has raised the stakes of the March elections. ', ' The Kenyan commission of inquiry that examined the 2007-2008 violence identified the conduct of the police as a fundamental problem, and since then little has changed, the report notes.', ' ', ' As a pointer to police ineptitude, the report says since August of last year, around 180 people have been killed in fighting between the agriculturalist Pokomo and the pastoralist Orma communities with little help coming from the police. ', ' Further, the possibility of violence has been exacerbated by increased struggle for power in the new devolved governance structure. ', ' In the Rift Valley, the report says no proper reconciliation ever took place. To the contrary, the report says the government adopted policies like skewed resettlement have widened the divide. ', ' The report makes a case study of the Kisumu vigilantes whom it identifies as American Marine Prime Minister Raila Odinga and China Group supporting Jubilee leaders Uhuru and Ruto. It says clashes occurred between the two groups last September after Uhuru visited Kisumu and police failed to intervene. ', ' However when a local ODM politician who had been involved in peace meetings between the two groups- Shem Onyango Kwega was shot dead in October police intervened and used excessive force against demonstrators. ', "" There has since be no accountability for the four deaths that followed the aftermath of Kwega's fatal shooting. The report calls on Kenyan leadership, African Union and foreign governments to close ranks and undertake resolute actions to make sure the March elections are free of violence. "", ' To compile the report, the group says it interviewed 228 people around Kenya. It says the people included community elders, youths, civil society representatives, government officials, security officials,representatives of humanitarian agencies, victims of violence and perpetrators of violence.

It featured the man known as the richest Black South African, Patrice Motsepe."", ""Motsepe, who is recognised by the Forbes Rich List as one of Africa's wealthiest people, announced on Wednesday, January 30 that he would be donating half of his estimated R20bn (Sh194,206,000,000) to improve the lives of the poor especially in the fields of education and health."", "" According to his Wikipedia profile, Motsepe was born in 1962 to a schoolteacher turned small businessman who owned a Spaza shop, the South African equivalent of a Kenyan tea kiosk, in Soweto that was popular with black mine workers. So it is not like he was born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth. The profile writer says it was from exposure from his father's kiosk that Motsepe learnt basic business principles and received firsthand exposure to mining."", "" A lawyer by training, Motsepe became the first black partner in the prestigious law firm Bowman Gilfillan in 1994 and specialised in mining and business law at a time when the new government had begun the process of promoting black empowerment and entrepreneurship. The SA government's black economic empowerment policy mandates that mining companies be at least 26 per cent black-owned."", ' Eventually by 1997 Motsepe set up a firm to begin buying the operating mines that would become the source of his wealth.', ""Motsepe's great act of generosity should put the spotlight on other wealthy Africans and I am hoping that In Kenya, wealthy people other than the nation's best known philanthropist, Manu Chandaria, will take the hint."", "" I still for instance cannot believe that there are still internally displaced people whose circumstances have not changed much since the abortion that passed for a general election in December 2007. I know we Kenyans like to leave everything to the government to do (Serekali isaidie), but some of the wealthiest Kenyans have enough money to spare to sort out the IDPs and other landless/homeless Kenyans with the stroke of a pen. Come on people, do something. After all, you can't take it with you when you die."", "" The second cash money story that grabbed my attention was that of Helen Zille, the leader of South Africa's main opposition party who was shoved into the spotlight after a spat with one of the country's most politically connected business families, the Guptas. The Gupta family of South Africa are the majority shareholders of a SA national daily, The New Age newspaper. The Guptas are also widely said to be benefactors of the ruling ANC and are known to have strong ties with President Jacob Zuma."", ' The newspaper, in conjunction with the state broadcaster and a number of parastatals are involved with the live TV broadcast of a regular breakfast briefing that gets leading government figures including President Zuma and politicians such as Mrs Zille to attend and answer questions from a ticket buying public as well as the breakfast TV audience.', "" Recently Zille and her party withdrew from the breakfasts claiming they were sponsored by state-owned enterprises and this 'misuse of public funds' was of benefit to the Gupta family through their newspaper. Zille claimed that she and her party colleagues had only spoken at the breakfast under the assumption that it was funded by The New Age and members of the public who had bought tickets to attend."", ' Immediately after Zille and Co. withdrew sections of the media came out with stories saying that Zille was being economical with the truth and quoting unnamed sources who claimed that Zille had gone to the Gupta family estate in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, in 2011 to ask for a donation and that she had left with a substantial cheque.', "" Zille denied the accusations but eventually had to admit to receiving money from a Gupta employee 'in his personal capacity.' My thoughts were immediately cast back to the case of Kenya's Goldenberg scam and it's chief architect Kamlesh Pattni who once famously produced a damning list of politicians, journalists and others who had received cash from him. I also remembered all the politicians who by day claimed to be opposed to former President Moi but by night sneaked into his home to eat Ugali with him."", "" Don't politicians and other leaders ever learn from the mistakes of others?"", '\n']"

', ' ', 'Raila is the leader of two political formations  the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and the Coalition for Reform and Democracy (CORD) and is seeking the presidency for a third time in a decade-and-a-half at the March 4 General Election.

The rivalry between the two men is the culmination of one of the longest political feuds of Kenyan politics, the fallout in the mid-1960s between their fathers which has now crossed a number of generations.', ' ', 'The Kenyattas are among Kenyas largest landowners of all races and nationalities, with their assets having been acquired during Jomo Kenyattas 18 months as the first Prime Minister of Kenya (June 1, 1963, to December 11, 1964) and 14 years as founder-President (December 12, 1964, to August 22, 1978).', ' ', 'The Odingas are also among the wealthiest Kenyans, with assets denominated in the billions of shillings, but clearly not in the Kenyattas class, which defines Old Money in this countrys African population. There are Europeans and Asians in Kenya who are quietly seriously wealthy and multiple millionaires even in the worlds hardest hard currencies, which makes them multiple shilling billionaires, some of whom are landowners on a scale to rival the Kenyattas, but they remain well under the political, or indeed any other, radar, except the taxmans.', ' ', 'Who Let the Dog-whistle Politics Out?', ' ', 'However, the Odingas have long cultivated a populist brand of politics, even veering far leftwards towards Marxism-Leninist rhetoric at the height of the Cold War, when Odinga Snr was a frequent and honoured guest in the chancelleries and capitals of the then Soviet Union and China. ', ' ', 'The Kenyatta political brand changed from fiery to establishmentarian a long time ago and has remained a pillar of the status quo for 50 years. After the deadly decade of the 1950s, when the British jailed him as Manager of Mau Mau and the freedom fighters in the forests promptly rephrased the Christian Lords Prayer handed down by Jesus Himself to substitute', ' Our Father who art in Kapenguria for Our Father who art in Heaven, the Kenyattas have long defined Kenyas home-grown capitalist establishment and have had no truck with any flavor of socialism.', ' ', 'Raila denounces Uhuru, his strongest opponent for Fourth President of Kenya, as the status quo incarnate and positions himself as the consistent face and agent of change, reform and social equity. ', ' ', 'But it is the land issue, for more than 100 years the most delicate and explosive issue in Kenya, that Raila has seized on and woven a dog-whistle politics narrative around it like none other since Jomo Kenyatta himself was denouncing the Mau Mau and they were claiming him for themselves as godhead and fountainhead in the 1950s.', ' Raila is travelling the length and breadth of Kenya on the campaign trail with one key message  that the Kenyattas own too much land for Uhuru to be a real reformist or to take Kenya to the next level of reforms, the full implementation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010.', ' For a nation of peasants and slum dwellers, and some of the worst income inequality indices in the world, this is a potentially incendiary message. However, Railas true audience, his real dog-whistle politics target subgroup, are the Rift Valley grassroots of Uhurus running mate Ruto. ', 'Uhuru pulled off the political coup of 2012 when he got Ruto to join him in the Jubilee Coalition. It was a stunning move and it generated the biggest realignment of political forces in a decade, since Raila himself led the exodus from then ruling party Kanu in October 2002 to form the National Rainbow Coalition (Narc) and scuttle President Daniel arap Mois succession agenda, which had Uhuru as its centerpiece. ', ' ', 'Uhurus move was based on such a radical proposal, an electoral union of the vast Mt. Kenya region and the Rift Valley vote blocs, that Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka of the Wiper Democratic Movement (WDM) ran all the way into a political union with Raila in CORD.', ' ', 'As we have often noted in these columns, the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin have never voted together in a presidential poll or a national referendum. However, the Kalenjin voted wholeheartedly for Uhuru in the 2002 race at President Mois urging but the rest of the country went for Mwai Kibaki as Third President of Kenya, overwhelming the Kanu ticket. ', ' ', ' ', 'At the core of the Land Question in Kenya is Kikuyu settlement in the Rift Valley. The political violence, both pre- and post-polls, of the multiparty era that begun in 1992, with the exception of the presidential transition poll of 2002, has had Rift Valley and the Kikuyu-Kalenjin divide as its focal point. The feat Uhuru and Ruto achieved in coming together ahead of only the second presidential transition poll in Kenyan history (and the first one with a runoff option) is the promise of erasing the Kikuyu-Kalenjin divide.', ' ', 'It is very specifically aimed at the Kalenjin in their Rift Valley redoubt. Raila is cleverly contriving to remind the Kalenjin that Rift Valley land was acquired on a massive scale by Kenyas biggest and therefore most land-hungry community  the Kikuyu  at a time when the regions most senior politician, Daniel Moi, was Vice President of the Republic. ', ' ', 'And though the Kalenjin then had no numbers imposing land hunger on them, their population has since exploded. Railas intention is to downgrade and degrade Rutos value to the Uhuru presidential campaign by reminding the Kalenjin that another Kikuyu President, a Kenyatta, imposed his terrific will on another Kalenjin deputy president, Moi, and if Jubilee takes State House history is likely to repeat itself. ', ' ', 'But only the Rift Valley audience hears this narrative, hence the dog-whistle paradigm. And that is exactly what Raila intends  that the Kalenjin Rift Valley audience hears him.', ' ', 'In Central Kenya, Railas dog-whistling on land issues is perceived quite differently. There, it is detonating all manner of conspiracies theories, including very dark suspicions indeed that Raila has a land redistribution agenda up his sleeve. ', 'This is a dreadful prospect for well-to-do Mt. Kenyans and an intriguing one for the millions of landless. The Kikuyu FM stations are full of speculative talk all the way into the wee hours of Railas real portent in harassing Uhuru so relentlessly on the land issue.', ' Caller after caller says Raila will change the Constitution to factor in land-grabs and redistribution as a way of addressing historical injustices; will therefore destabilize Kenya Big Time; will keep the Mt. Kenyans tied up in endless litigation over land issues; will make the Rift Valley, now pacified after such hard work by Uhuru and Ruto, once again a dangerous place.', ' ', 'Early in the week, Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo issued a security advisory urging politicians not to revisit contentious land issues on the campaign trail. ', ' ', 'Responding directly to Kimaiyo in a campaign speech at Migori in his Luo Nyanza political backyard, Raila declared: The police cannot prescribe what we should or should not discuss.The directive also negates free speech, which is guaranteed in the Constitution.', 'This spectacle generated a shiver up and down Mt. Kenya and social media and the FM stations, including online, with Diaspora Mt. Kenyans, also commenting. ', ' ', 'Kimaiyo is not just another senior police officer in Railas perspective. He was his security consultant during the ill-fated 2007 presidential campaign; his candidature for the top Kenya Police Service position was a very special one indeed as he maintains the most cordial relations with Ruto and Uhuru on top of receiving the PMs own endorsement; and he hails from the Rift Valley, the nations epicenter of controversial land issues. Raila was instrumental, too, in the appointment of the Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya, Dr. Willy Mutunga, a one-time fellow political detainee and exile.  ', ' ', 'There has not been a top cop in Kenya of Kimaiyos political fault-line-bridging credentials since the late James Kanyotu, Kenyas longest-serving national spymaster. For Raila to treat him so brusquely so promptly on the issue of the Land Question is a signal being interpreted in Mt. Kenya as a sure-fire indication of the strength of the PMs near-future intentions for a radical rethink of land policy in Kenya.', ' ', 'Such a rethink has long been dreaded by the landed Mt. Kenya elite, owners of the nations choicest agricultural land and real estate. The real estate boom of the Kibaki era has signaled the arrival of Kenyas biggest and richest middle class yet  and it is still overwhelmingly Central Kenyan.  ', ' ', 'Also joining in the fray were Government Spokesman Muthui Kariuki and National Integration and Cohesion Commission Chairman Mzalendo Kivunjia, both of whom asserted that controversial land ownership issues belong to forums other than emotive political rallies, for instance the courts and other arbitration channels. Kariuki spoke of discussing land issues at political rallies as a powder keg and called it potentially lethal.', ' ', 'Raila and Kalonzo strenuously disagreed with Kimaiyo, Kariuki and Kivunjia. The VP, a lawyer, said he had reviewed the top cops advisory and it amounted to gagging the political class and Kenyans generally on a burning issue of national interest.', ' ', 'Is Railas dog-whistling strategy on land issues a vote winner? His treatment of IG Kimaiyos pioneering security advisory for campaigning politicians would seem to indicate that the strategy is too important for him to amend, let alone drop.', ' This can only mean there must be some indications on the ground of some success, or likely success, for Raila to hold on with such tenacity to the dog whistle on the land issue.', '\n']"

First, as practical matter, were the duo to be elected, both will be absentee president and vice-president as they will be spending all their time at the Hague defending their cases.', 'Ruto has said they can use technology to run the country from the Hague but this is a joke and the fact that they even raise this as a possibility is the more reason why they should not be elected.', 'There is no going around the fact that its impractical to govern a country when one is defending himself in The Hague, which requires their physical presence during trial now estimated to run for two to three years.', 'Second, given this fact, one must assume that the two intend to abscond and not attend their trial, or if convicted, not to show up for punishment, which is no less criminal. In fact, absconding ICC trial is criminal under the Rome Statute and consequences for doing so are not only specific to the absconding suspects, they are even more importantly national in scope.', 'For example, were Uhuru and Ruto to abscond once elected, Kenya will be made a pariah state like Sudan. This means we can forget any gains we hope to get from full implementation of our constitution, which may not happen, anyway, with the two in power. ', 'One consequence of being labeled a pariah state is that Kenya will be subjected to economic sanctions and none of its officials will be given visas to travel to other countries, especially those that matter to our welfare.', 'If Kenya is cut from the world economic chain, that will be the end of our country. You have no idea what the consequences of such economic sanctions can be. ', 'Just the other day, Sweden banned the importation of miraa to that country, a decision which miraa exporter Dan Aritho says is certain to adversely impact the economy of Meru county.', 'One need not be an exporter like Aritho to understand the devastating impact of shutting the country from the world market. It goes without saying we shouldnt even entertain the thought of being slapped with sanctions of this nature.', 'Third, besides economic sanctions, the election of Uhuru and Ruto will most likely see the United States, European Union states, and others that support the ICC process shun us diplomatically.', 'Uhuru was quoted as saying recently Kenya does not need the West. This is simply another reason he should not be elected as president because he fails to understand the importance of maintaining our relations with the West. ', 'That being the case, the only thing this writer and many others see as Uhurus only option were he to salvage his political career, is to first step-aside from vying for the presidency and chart a path of redemption. That starts with forging a good working relationship with Raila.', ' Working with Raila makes sense because hes likely to be our next president and even if Uhuru were to give him a run for his money, hell ultimately fall short as he sees his friend being sworn in as president.', 'Indeed, the best thing Uhuru could do is simply step-aside and endorse Raila. There is nothing wrong in doing so other than entrenched old notions of political beliefs we must shake off from our body politic.', 'Stepping aside and endorsing Raila will bring with it immediate and long term benefits for Uhuru that wont exist were Uhuru to defy common sense and continue in his ill-advised quest for the presidency.', 'One such immediate benefit is that Uhuru would have elevated himself to a statesman by putting the interests of the country firstsomething very few politicians ever do in life. ', 'By elevating himself as such, he can then find ample time to defend his case at the Hague and notwithstanding the outcome, he will have a far larger constituency sympathetic to his situation, especially if hes convicted than he otherwise would.', 'The latter, coupled with a president in office willing to utilise state resources to bring these cases to an end consistent with national security interesta case Uhuru cannot make as president for the reason that most people oppose his candidacy because they believe and rightly so that Uhuru wants to use the presidency to defy the ICC process.', 'The irony of it is, this would be no different were Uhuru to endorse someone other than Raila as that will clearly be seen as a project designed to do just that, namely, thwarting or altogether defying the ICC process.', 'However, endorsing Raila will be different because it will first be one significant unifying event of the country that can only be furthered by Raila acting in the best interests of the country in seeking an end to the ICC process consistent with the rule of law and justice for the victims.

Those from China were worth Sh144 billion in the same year.', ' ', 'Analysts say India has managed to clinch the lions share of Kenyas import volumes because of, among others, the prevailing cordial foreign policy between the two countries since Kenya gained independence, relatively cheaper goods, quality, and proximity of its ports to Kenya.', ' ', 'The main imports from India include textiles, petroleum products obtained from bituminous minerals (other than crude), medical equipment and drugs, pharmaceuticals, flat-rolled iron and non-alloy steel products, electrical goods, food-processing machinery, special purpose motor vehicles and trucks among others.', ' ', 'There are quite a number of factors why Kenya is importing more from India. For instance, you will realise that many products on sale in Kenyan retail stores  such as textiles (garments)  come from India. They are cheaper and as we know, Kenyan consumers are sensitive to price, making these a top choice, said Tiberius Barasa, the executive director of the Centre for Policy Research, a governance and public policy analysis think-tank.', ' ', 'But we are realising that its not just about price but also quality that is standing out for Indian imports, and this is something that can definitely be sustained in the near-term. Regional proximity of India also makes it easy to travel to and to transport goods to Kenya, said Barasa.', ' ', 'The Indian High Commissioner to Kenya Sibabrata Tripathi echoes these sentiments, saying that a combination of factors does indeed make India a market of choice for Kenyan importers.', ' ', 'These include proximity, particularly of ports on the west coast of India, price-related factors and not least, quality of products, said Tripathi.', ' ', 'He says that although Kenya accounts for less than one per cent of Indias global exports, its importance as an export destination is highly valued by Indian exporters.

Imports from the UAE amounted to Sh13.2 billion, while Chinas were worth Sh12.1 billion in the period, according to the KNBS data.', ' ', 'The reason why China might be thought to be to be doing booming business with Kenya is because of its presence in key projects such as roads. Thats where it has an upper hand perhaps over Asian rivals, plus it can afford to give Kenya grants  thats its competitive edge. India has its own challenges and may not afford to give grants, said Barasa.', ' ', 'A trade imbalance however exists between Kenya and India, as the latter does not feature among the top 10 major destinations for the countrys exports. This is attributable to Kenya being a net importer.', ' ', 'Kenyas exports are mainly agricultural products such as tea, coffee and cut flowers as well as hides. The major destinations for Kenyan exports are Uganda, Tanzania, UK, Pakistan, Netherlands, Egypt, USA, Rwanda and Germany.', ' ', 'The bilateral economic partnership between our two countries should not be seen through the growing trade volume alone, Tripathi said, adding that diplomatic exchanges between the two countries, particularly at cabinet level, have played an important role in improving trade relations.', ' ', 'There are about 40 top Indian firms with offices in Kenya currently  including three banks and a number of insurance firms  which are proof of the increasingly cosy trade relations with Kenya.', ' ', 'India also offers lines of credit to its African partners, Kenya included, said Tripathi.', ' ', 'Commonality of business languages  besides the proximity of ports on Indias west coast, price-related factors and product quality  may as well partly explain the swelling trade volumes that have catapulted India to be top choice for Kenyan importers.', ' ', 'According to Barasa, relations between Kenya and India are likely to deepen and grow going forward as the country moves away from Europe and America to Asia and other Africa countries.', ' ', 'There is a big market here for Indian goods which India may not want to lose, he said.', ' ', 'The Indian business community has also in recent years become active in participating in both product-specific and general trade fairs held in Nairobi, facilitated and co-ordinated by the High Commissions Commercial Office.', ' ', 'In addition, a growing number of young Kenyans are opting to study or train in India either on scholarships or self-sponsorship, which shows the relationship between the two countries goes beyond raw business if we can put it so.', ' ', 'We, in association with the Government of Kenya, administer over 100 fellowships up to doctoral level under the India Technical and Economic Co-operation (ITEC) and other programmes, said Tripathi.', ' He said Kenya is also an emerging market for Indian tour operators, while Indian consultants offer services in areas ranging from road construction to hotel management.', '\n']"

John I doubt that anyone certainly not me would take the serious step of running for the office of president casually. Two I have not had the money to flash around with helicopters but there has been a lot of preparation. I have been to more than 30 counties on the ground talking to people. I may not have been flamboyant in terms of even attracting media attention but I have been around, that is how we got over 2,000 registered voters joining the party in more than 30 counties.

John its been a sacrifice in the personal level, in the material level, in the level of liberty it has not been a walk in the park, ushering in multi-partism, ushering in democracy, increasing the democratic spirits. Some of us had a vision for this country, the new constitution was not an end to itself we knew it was a means to an end. That vision is yet to be realised. ', 'Listen John no country in Africa can continue to live on borrowed time permanently and this ethnic balkanization playing our politics which by the way is forbidden in the new constitution, forbidden even in the Political Parties Act, but we persist to mobilise along ethnic lines. We are playing around with time bombs. There has to be somebody who is a lighthouse. ', 'During the colonial times, the social economic policies in the colonial period favoured a small class of people at the top. At independence we adopted the same policies economically and socially, that is what was there in the first regime, second regime and even in the third regime. ', 'I was chairing the parliamentary committee on the constitution and legal affairs and the members of my committee said its our responsibility to guide the country on how the elections could be held that would be free and fair so that even the losers would accept the results. So we came up with a package of reforms, the top reform was the electoral commission.', "" We had proposed that the members who were going to conduct the 07 elections their names would be taken to parliament, be vetted and 'waidhinishwe na bunge' ...I would say that had the package of reforms gone through we would have free and fair elections, we would have avoided the ICC, the losers would have accepted the results. It was the refusal to accept that package of reforms that was purely targeted at elections to give us time to get a new comprehensive constitution that is the genesis of the clashes.

The problems facing the Nyanza people or Western province or Ukambani are the same problems facing the people in central Kenya there are very many poor people in central Kenya by the way. So it is an issue of the way we have managed our economy, our politics and our social policies. Those who mobilise along ethnic lines they are not doing it for and on behalf of their supporters but it's for there own political agenda.

A safina government for every shilling spent on the roads, rehabilitating roads, tarmacking roads we would spend two shillings harvesting rainwater across the entire country, we would have a very comprehensive policy of harvesting rainwater. Almost every two three years you get Kenyans dying through floods. The same year, the same Kenyans are dying of hunger and drought. How come we have never invested in a comprehensive policy manner harvesting that rainwater, so that is where most of the money would go to. We would invest in research in agriculture to come up with high yielding seed varieties for different agricultural products. Extension services to farmers, then policy interventions in terms of marketing so as to ensure that the farmer is getting an honest return... ', 'I would start with the most disadvantaged counties. I would start with North Eastern province then move from there.

I am not for fundamental rearrangement, conservatives, pro-status quo, I am going to rearrange all that. ', 'I am not condemning anything. We went wrong in 1963, it has got to be corrected. Few people have got the commitment or the courage to do so I do. Even those historical injustices relating to land will be addressed. ', 'We have got a team. I am discussing policy, and believe you me, it would be reckless to come and disclose all your strategies on television. ', 'Take it from me, they are there. I am not just talking casually, this are things that we have gone through and decided that if you want Kenya to be catapulted from being a third world country, to being a second world, first world country, this is what we must do.

', 'They are there and you will see them. I am here to discuss the policies, they are there to implement it. Allow me to give this one final example, iron of very high grade is being mined in Taita Taveta. The person given a license stocks iron and when he has got enough to fill a ship, a ship comes all the way from Beijing its loaded, goes there and is smelted. Then we import steel and you know how expensive steel is. A condition for mining iron will be to build a smelting plant here. ', 'The cost of steel in Kenya will come down, provide employment, value added this is what I am talking about. Policies that target at giving an opportunity to the majority not to the few. Our economic social policies are targeting capital owners of banks, owners of insurance companies, big scheme land owners and so on.', "" We don't come up with policies that can give opportunities to a majority of Kenyan people, that's why we are one of of the most unequal societies in the whole world in terms of the gap between the rich and the poor. "", 'That is the root cause for the insecurity we have John. So even the wealthy and those owners of capital they should support Safina in rearranging this because we are not against wealth. ', 'However if they want to enjoy their wealth whether ill gotten or otherwise, they should support Safina government because only our policies will be able to bring back genuine security in the country.

Let me break it down for you: ', ' About 4.3 million voters30 percent of all registered voters are expected not to vote in this election. ', ' Over half of all Nairobi voters stayed home in the last election ', ' Only North-eastern and Coast have had lower turnouts than Nairobi in the last three elections (1997, 2002 and 2007) ', ' The middle class is the least likely group of voters to vote in this election ', ' Your vote is the deciding vote in this election ', ' Your vote counts for stability, security and peace ', ' The choice is clear: Vote! ', 'Because I can find no better way to ask the undecided middle class to get serious, about getting out and voting  let me borrow from Vimal Shahs amazing letter to the middle class. ', 'Do you know just how crucial your vote is to the future of this country? Why are some of you so indifferent to politics? While I do agree with you that a lack of true leaders amongst many of our politicians is the reason this country is not as economically developed or as ethnically tolerant as it should be, your lack of interest in politics is also partly to blame for this leadership void. ', 'Taking to Twitter and Facebook to ridicule politicians and whine about the loss of the better candidate in the recently held party primaries cannot be defined as active involvement in politics or the running of the country but going out to vote can. ', 'It is a shame that many in the middle class have taken a back seat when it comes to politics. You need to understand that your vote counts just as much as that of the politician and the low income earner, and that no election is too trivial for you. But you seem not to know this, which is why politicians always by-pass you in favour of the masses who are willing to cast their votes for those whose policies they know nothing about. ', 'If you think Im wrong, tell me: do politicians hold rallies in Kileleshwa or Karen? Why do they always retreat to the low income settlements if their inhabitants do not matter? They do this because they know you will not vote anyway! ', 'The middle class can influence the direction this country takes just by being a little more interested in the political affairs of this country. It is not just about talking to your gated-community neighbours about how poorly run this country is; it is about positively influencing everybody you come into contact with, including the domestic workers and others you rely on to keep your home/office/business running. ', 'Every day in our papers we read that Kenyas middle class is growing, backed by figures that show, for example, that the number of personal vehicles on our roads doubled between 2002 and 2007. If that is true, then the influence of the middle class should also be growing. If the middle class contributes so much to this economy, shouldnt this same class actively participate in the running of the same economy it helps fuel? ', 'Your indifference to politics is not a sign of your superiority over the easily misguided masses. By hiding behind social media instead of queuing to vote, you are saying that you do not care about Kenya. By refusing to use your power to vote you are relinquishing any right to comment on the affairs of this country, be they social, economic or political. ', 'As we head towards the March 4, 2013 general election you need to demonstrate that your patriotism is more than wearing a Proud to be Kenyan T-shirt bought at your local mall. ', 'It is now time to get off social media and take action: be one of the voters who will queue to vote on March 4. It is time to take the future of this country into your hands, and not only on your keyboard. Our country needs you. Vote for integrity and vote for the people who you think will bring the change and the future that you desire  but please DO GO OUT AND VOTE! ', 'Enough said. Join me this morning on the Big Breakfast as we get ready to swing the vote as only we can. Yes, we are going to swing the vote, we are going to vote. We must, we have no option  Kenya needs us to get out and vote.', '\n']"

Republic, Crim. App. No. 497 of 2007 are automatically a nullity.', ' Despite the expansion by the Court of Appeal regarding the issue of legal representation, it recognized the implications thereof and consequently the need to make major policy and legislative changes, and to make financial resources available in order to put into effect the constitutional requirement that accused persons be availed legal representation in situations where substantial injustice would result if the accused person was undefended, and for those charged with the offences that carry the death penalty.', ' The High Court can only try cases in which the law confers jurisdiction upon it, and there is no doubt about where jurisdiction for trial of robbery with violence cases lies.', 'The law has provided very clearly with regard to the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Courts to try the offence, and as long as the Magistrates Courts conduct trials within the parameters established under the law, there would be no basis for interfering with their mandate.', ' The intention behind the provision of Article 157 (10) of the Constitution was to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions carry out his constitutional mandate without interference from any person or organ, unless there was clear evidence of violation of a partys rights under the Constitution or violation of the Constitution itself.', 'If such an order was to be made, it would be in individual cases on the basis of very clear and cogent evidence that substantial injustice would result, and cannot be made as a blanket order in respect of all cases of robbery with violence.', ' Taking into account the practical implications to the public interest and the rights of the indigent persons, stopping the DPP from carrying out prosecutions until legal representation has been provided would not only be contrary to the societal interests in seeing those who have committed crimes brought to trial, but would also lead to violations of the rights of the accused persons themselves.', ' Regarding the State action on the right to legal representation, it is clear that necessary steps have already been undertaken to put in place measures required to provide legal representation as required under the provisions of Article 50 (2) (h) of the Constitution.', 'These include the drafting of a Legal Aid Policy and Bill, and the rolling out of pilot projects in various parts of the country for the provision of legal representation to indigent Kenyans.

Tackling the demand for ivory must be a global priority.', 'As the epicenter of illegal ivory demand, China must understand that its global leadership derives not from the scale of its wealth or military power but from its moral courage to stand up against international crime.', 'It behooves China to declare an indefinite unilateral moratorium on ivory imports. The 40th Anniversary of CITES on March 3rd 2013 and the 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to be held in Bangkok is a chance to send strong and clear messages on combating the illegal trade in wildlife.', 'But seriously, the very idea of killing and trading in high value wildlife as an incentive for conservation is morally reprehensible.', ' ', 'Dr. Awiti is an Ecosystems Ecologist based at Aga Khan University, Nairobi', '\n']"

This is so especially with family property, more so, the matrimonial home. Husbands were the sole custodians and owners of the matrimonial homes and would therefore dispose them and charge them at will, without considering the effect of rendering the family homeless. The sanctity of the title document had the effect that if the husband was the only registered owner, then the wife had no rights over the property.', 'The new land laws introduced a new aspect in land transactions that involve matrimonial property. Firstly, spousal rights have been recognised as overriding interests in land. Section 28 of the Land Registration Act provides that unless the contrary is expressed in the register, all registered land shall be subject to the following overriding interests:', '(a) spousal rights over matrimonial property;', 'Section 93 (1) of the Land Registration Act provides that subject to the law on matrimonial property, if a spouse obtains land for the co-ownership and use of both spouses or, all the spouses', '(a) there shall be a presumption that the spouses shall hold the land as joint tenants unless', '(i) a provision in the certificate of ownership or the certificate of customary ownership clearly states that one spouse is taking the land in, his or her own name only or that the spouses are taking the land as joint tenants; or', '(ii) the presumption is rebutted in the manner stated in this subsection;', 'This provision allows for the recognition of spouses as co-owners of matrimonial property, even though the property maybe registered in one of the spouses names. The law further provides that if land is held in the name of one spouse only but the other spouse or spouses contribute by their labour or other means to the productivity, upkeep and improvement of the land, that spouse or those spouses shall be deemed by virtue of that labour to have acquired an interest in that land in the nature of an ownership in common of that land with the spouse in whose name the certificate of ownership or customary certificate of ownership has been registered. This provision is aimed at helping spouses who contribute indirectly in the acquisition of property but whose names are not included in the title documents of the property.', 'The law also requires that the spouse must give consent to any transaction involving matrimonial property for that transaction to be valid. Section 93 (3) provides that where a spouse who holds land or a dwelling house in his or her name individually undertakes a disposition of that land or dwelling house', '(a) the lender shall, if that disposition is a charge, be under a duty to inquire of the borrower on whether the spouse has or spouses have, as the case may be, have consented to that charge; or', '(b) the assignee or transferee shall, if that disposition is an assignment or a transfer of land, be under a duty to inquire of the assignor or transferor on whether the spouse or spouses have consented to that assignment. This provision is meant to protect the spouse and ensure that no land transactions are carried out without their knowledge and consent. The law further provides in subsection 4 that If the spouse undertaking the disposition deliberately misleads the lender or, the assignee or transferee by the answers to the inquiries made in accordance with subsection (3)(a) or (3)(b), the disposition shall be void at the option of the spouse or spouses who have not consented to the disposition. A spouse, whose consent is not sought, can therefore seek to invalidate the transaction on those grounds. Spousal consent is therefore not an option, but mandatory in all transactions involving matrimonial property.', '\n']"

', 'And candidates for Kiambu senator said that they variously intended, if elected, to help Kiambu youth acquire life skills, introduce modern technology in fish farming, or fight poverty at village level.', 'How Moi thinks that as senator he would buy a police helicopter is a mystery. Even a governor would find this hard: the constitution gives no functions about the police to the counties. As the law stands, senators will have no similar fund to the CDF to spend in their counties. Anyway, CDF funds have hardly been in the helicopter buying league.', 'What will a senator do?', 'The role is not to govern a county but is as a MP: of the about-to-be-reborn senate. Reading the constitution gives the impression of a very limited set of functions for the senate.', 'The main one is law making. But, though every Bill, or draft Act of Parliament, must be passed by the National Assembly, only Bills that affect counties have to be approved by the Senate. This means anything that affects the constitutional powers of counties, or their finances or elections to county offices.', 'A Bill about something to be done only by the national government, which does not affect what county governments do, will not have to be approved by the Senate.', 'In fact, almost all the functions given to the Senate concern the county governments. It is important in allocation of national revenue to, and between, counties once every five years. ', 'The Senate makes the initial decision (it must use the work of the Commission on Revenue Allocation, constitutional principles, public input, and the input of others including the county governors). Its decision is final unless two-thirds of the National Assembly reject or change it (then there is a procedure to try to achieve agreement).', 'The Senate has other important finance-related roles; according to the constitution it exercises oversight over national revenue allocated to the county governments, and this is backed up by detailed provisions of the Pubic Financial Management Act.', 'But when the MPs passed the Constituency Development Fund Bill last month, they removed provisions giving the Senate a role in overseeing the CDF, changing a proposed supervisory Senate Committee to a National Assembly Committee - even a parliamentary committee did not satisfy them  and providing that CDF Regulations must be approved by the National Assembly not the Senate.', 'It can require a commission or an independent office holder like the Auditor General etc. to submit a special report  it is unclear whether it can do this only in connection with the roles it is given or for other purposes as well.', 'It must approve any changes to county boundaries. And the Senate must approve any suspension of a county government by the President (if that government engages in actions that are deemed to be against the common needs and interests of the citizens of the county, says the County Governments Act) and can end a suspension. It also approves a town becoming a city (Urban Areas and Cities Act).', 'A county may appeal to the Senate if the Transition Authority decides that the county does not have the capacity to exercise a governmental function that the county wants to be transferred to it.', 'The Senate does have two truly important functions in connection with national government.', 'One will, hopefully, rarely, if ever, be exercised: if a motion for the removal of the President or Deputy President is passed in the National Assembly, it will go to the Senate which will appoint a committee of its members to investigate the charges, and if it found they were justified, the Senate could remove the President or Deputy by a two-thirds vote of all its members. Perhaps, rather more often, the Senate may be called upon to perform a similar role in the removal of a governor under the County Governments Act.', 'The other major role would be approving constitutional amendments, whether or not they affect counties specifically.', 'A Senator will no doubt be able to bargain for benefits for his or her county, as US Senators do: I shall vote for this Bill that you, the government, want only if you do this-and-this for my county  what the American call pork-barrelling. Their ability to do this may be less than for MPs  because they will vote on far fewer Bills.', 'Senators must clearly be people with sound financial heads on their shoulders, with good judgment, as well as all the integrity qualifications that Kenyans are looking for but that law makers have so dismally failed to require.

This will remove such projects from the realm of social responsibility and make them legally enforceable.', 'Every affected organisation shall enter into a county-benefit-sharing agreement with the respective county government, the Bill says. This will essentially help communities living around the mining site to keep the firms legally accountable to the provisions in the agreements signed.', 'Communities living in areas where natural resources, including water and forests, stand to benefit further from the projects pledged by the firms.', 'The Bill also allows county governments to be in control of the mining activities going on in their areas and safeguard the interest of their population.', 'A county-benefit-sharing committee composed of the county executive committee member responsible for finance, the chairperson of the committee of the respective county assembly responsible for matters relating to natural resources, and five persons elected by the local community where the resource bestrides will be formed.', 'It also provides avenues for county administrations to make demands, including employment quotas, where the county demands a certain percentage of employees be from the devolved unit.

Under the Bill, the county where the resource is utilised will receive 32 per cent of the revenues while the national governments portion has been reduced to 48 per cent.', 'Last year, Kenya earned Sh19.6 billion from sale of minerals like gold, gemstones and soda ash. county governments well-endowed with resources will have a stable flow of additional revenues and this is expected to catapult the local economies.

While secularism is the enemy that steals the faithful in the West, evangelical forms of Christianity are seducing Catholic believers away in what we used to call the Third World.', ' There are many who blame this haemorrhage on the outgoing pope (the first time anybody has ever used that phrase about a pope, for they normally die in office, like the emperors did). Benedict was chosen by his colleagues because they believed that he would fight off fundamental change, and he performed his duty well.', 'His resignation for health reasons is an innovation, but it is the first that he has been guilty of.', ' He held the line on abortion (a sin in almost all circumstances), homosexuality (likewise, unless the person remains entirely celibate), married or female priests (definitely not), re-marriage after divorce (ditto), and contraception (under no circumstances, though he later said that HIV-positive prostitutes might be justified in asking their clients to use condoms).', ' What the Catholic Church is really fighting is modernisation, which it sees as moral decline. Perhaps it is right (though I dont think so personally), but it is losing the battle. Yet Benedict XVI and the church hierarchy are condemned to fight this battle until the last ditch, because they believe, probably correctly, that full modernisation would make them irrelevant.', ' So theres no point in going on about how Pope Benedict XVI (or will we go back to calling him Cardinal Ratzinger after the end of this month?) failed to modernise the Church. He wasnt hired to do that. The only pope who did try was John XXIII, and he died fifty years ago. Every pope since then (including the charismatic but deeply conservative John Paul II) has seen his task as being to stem the tide of change and restore the old order.', ' The job was largely complete even before Benedict became pope seven years ago. His job has merely been to ensure that there is no backsliding into liberalism, relativism and other modernist errors, and he has achieved that by ensuring that almost the entire College of Cardinals (the men who choose the next pope) are reliably conservative and orthodox.', ' The College had already been stuffed with conservative cardinals by his predecessor, John Paul II, so even there he really didnt have to do much except steer the same steady course. Not a single one of the cardinals who are seen as papabili (men who might be elected as pope) could be described as liberal or reformist. There will be a new pope, but nothing is going to change. The haemorrhage will continue.', ' ', '\n']"

On the eve of the voting, we watched on television images of Administrative Police being dispatched to the west under circumstances that were murky at best and officially denied."", 'The GSU played a heavy role at the KICC during the post-vote tallying period and ECK Chair Samuel Kivuitu was whisked away under heavy security to announce the chosen winner with a small private audience and cameras only from the KBC.', ""As violence arose from protest and its suppression, and from gangs and militias which were in some cases sponsored by political players, people around the world saw the indelible image of Kenya's GSU, in full paramilitary battle gear, standing shoulder to shoulder, to protect . . . an otherwise empty park."", 'Thus, it was clear that the priority of the government was to control access to the politically-hallowed ground of Uhuru Park rather than to protect the citizens.', 'The Waki Commission determined that the largest single grouping of those killed were those shot by police.', 'From this background, I watched the course of the implementation of the so-called reform agenda over the years since. Reform of domestic security services has been crucial if Kenya is to become a fully functioning democracy in which the government operates under rules of law to serve the country and its citizens rather than protecting narrower political interests to the point of killing innocent Kenyans with impunity.', 'On balance, what we have seen from the current government is delivery of only a tiny fraction of the necessary police reform in the five years since the disaster in the wake of the last election. When the new constitution was finally passed in the contested referendum in the summer of 2010, it included among its structural reforms the creation of the new Inspector General post to lay the groundwork for a more professionalised force less subject to political manipulation.', 'Unfortunately, the priorities of those who ended up in power through the botched 2007 election and the mediated settlement have been since the passage of the constitution primarily elsewhere. ', 'How any of us could be surprised by that would be beyond me. Thus, it was not until late 2011 that the crucial implementing legislation, the National Police Service Act, was passed by Parliament. ', 'This is legislation that was crafted carefully with serious expert input and had the government than moved forward with some minimal sense of urgency to implement the proscribed reforms Kenya could be in a different situation today. For reasons that no one seems to have attempted to explain, however, the government sat on its hands until late last year as yet another election approached.', ""We now have an Inspector General appointed and confirmed finally, after the oversight panels were belatedly constituted. Thus, finally the senior leadership to implement the planned reforms is in place and at some point in the future, if things are not disrupted by next month's election, there can be hope of substantive reform. "", ""For anyone that doesn't fear the role of the Kenya's domestic security forces in the meantime, including in regard to the new election and the politicians, please look around Kenya, to the Tana River Delta, to Garissa, to Baragoi, and to gang-infested cities and towns in whatever region."", ""Read the report from Amnesty International dated January 30 entitled Kenya Police Reform: A Drop in the Ocean. Read the report released by Human Rights Watch on February 8 entitled High Stakes: Political Violence and Kenya's 2013 Elections. "", 'These organisations dispatched professional researchers to conduct interviews on the ground at higher and lower levels throughout the country to report on the reality of security conditions without political spin or the bland dismissive reassurance of government spokesmen and bureaucrats.', 'Part of what is so disappointing about the pace of progress in police reform is that it has so much impact on the lives of ordinary Kenyans. Unlike electoral commissions that play a specific role on a periodic basis, the difference between good policing, bad policing or no policing is a key determinant of the quality of life for Kenyans and the failure of the political class to act with alacrity in this area says a great deal about where their priorities lie in spite of the opportunity to learn hard lessons from 2007-08.', 'I will say that I am concerned for the new Inspector General David Kimaiyo, specifically. He seems to be professional and he has long experience. I was especially intrigued to read about him in the report of the Parliamentary committee that investigated the Artur Brothers fiasco in 2006. ', 'As a senior police official at that time, he was one of those witnesses who was initially obstructed from testifying by those in power in spite of being subpoenaed, but his testimony was eventually secured. ', 'It is good to know that some people were at least afraid of what he would say. Nonetheless, he is in a new position set down on top of an old and dysfunctional organisation that he has inherited and that he does not have time to change before the election. ', 'The news already reports a rift over appointment authority between Kimaiyo and the chair of the new National Police Service Commissionthe kind of kinks in a new system that should be expected and that inevitably take time.', ""Ultimately, Kimaiyo even on paper, is only one member of the National Security Council. Even though he has some additional theoretical authority, he is to implement rather than set the government's security policy. "", 'Like Samuel Kivuitu in the weeks before the election in 2007, he has respect and credibility from his past, but he is one man only, one vote on security policy, and not fully in control of what will happen even within the police service at this point. This should be a sobering thought in light of what we all saw play out in the last election.', '\n']"

That 43 per cent Mutahi Ngunyi speaks of may actually represent the best that Uhuru can hope for.', ' ', 'Nothing has provoked as much controversy in this election cycle, as the narrative about a tyranny of numbers put out by the veteran political commentator Mutahi Ngunyi a few weeks ago.', 'The basic points of this narrative are as follows: historically, Kenyans always vote on a clear tribal pattern, irrespective of what the issues are in any election. As such if you look at the combinations of key tribal leaders who have agreed to work together in a political coalition, you can more or less ascertain how many votes each coalition will get.', 'Arising from this comes two key points: that (as one source puts it) Jubilee Coalition and Its Tyranny of Numbers: if history is a reliable reference point, we assume that the Gema and the Kalenjin nations will vote for this coalition as a bloc. If they do, the combined vote for this bloc is 6.2 Million or 43.2 per cent of the total vote according to the IEBC December 18 voter registration tallies.', 'This source adds that The CORD coalition is primarily composed of the Luo nation and 80% of the Kamba nation. The combined starting point for CORD coalition is 19.2 per cent or 2.74 million votes...arrived at this figure by adding the Prime Ministers ethnic support (Luo) and that of the Vice President (Kamba).', 'This, of course is what caused so much consternation among those who support the Cord and so much rejoicing among the supporters of the Jubilee Coalition.', 'By any standards, a political coalition starting off with 43 per cent of the total Kenyan vote locked up in its strongholds would be more or less invincible. Especially if the principal rival coalition has only 20 per cent roughly, as a starting point. Indeed Mr Ngunyi actually went so far  in his TV interview  as to call the presidential election in Jubilees favour, announcing that the outcome of this election had been predetermined at the voter registration exercise, and CORD was bound to lose.', ' ', 'RETURN OF THE SPECTRE OF MASSIVE RIGGING', 'This kind of wild generalisation would be merely amusing, for very many reasons, if not for the fact that it has brought back the spectre of massive rigging into the upcoming election.', 'When speaking in private, the hard core of Jubilee Coalition supporters  who base their expectations entirely on the tyranny of numbers theory  claim that they are sailing to victory with the greatest of ease. And that nothing short of phenomenal rigging could possibly deny Uhuru Kenyatta the presidency in the very first round of voting.', 'On the other hand, the partisans of Cord, are willing to come out quite openly to allege that the whole purpose of this deeply-flawed theory of the tyranny of numbers is to create the right psychological framework for massive rigging by Jubilee. And that the whole point of this theory being put out in the first place, is to provide a narrative which will be used to explain why and how Uhuru Kenyatta won  after he has been rigged in on March 4.', 'Thus, it is worth considering what merit, if any, this theory has, and whether it is in any way an accurate rendering of what we should expect in the elections.', ' ', 'COULD ALL THE POLLSTERS BE WRONG?', 'Perhaps the most effective refutation of the tyranny of numbers theory in the results of the recent opinion polls. Virtually all the reputable pollsters are unanimous in predicting, as of this point, a dead heat between the two leading presidential candidates, with the Cord candidate, Raila Odinga considered to have a slim lead.', 'In general, Uhuru Kenyatta is rated to have somewhere between 42 per cent and 44 per cent of the vote at this point in time, and Raila Odinga is rated at between 44 per cent and 46 per cent. Given the margin of error in such polls, this amounts to a situation in which either candidate could just as easily win.', 'Interestingly enough, this is more or less what the pollsters had as Kenya went into the 2007 general election: Raila had a slight lead over the incumbent, President Mwai Kibaki in that election, which was also generally judged to be too close to call.', 'To this, we may add the fact that Kenyan pollsters have accurately predicted the results of the 2002 presidential elections; the 2005 referendum; the 2007 presidential elections; and the 2010 referendum.', 'This is a track record of reliability which would be acceptable in any nation, and at any time since the advent of opinion polling.', 'So, the first question which could be posed to those who uncritically accept the theory of the tyranny of numbers is, If Raila Odinga starts off with only 20 per cent of the vote, then where does he get the additional 25 per cent of the vote that pollsters are predicting he will get?', ""Or put another way, since Uhuru Kenyattas supposed tyranny of numbers only amounts to 43 per cent - the same percentage of support that the pollsters give him  does this mean that only the Gema and the Kalenjin will vote for Uhuru, while almost everyone else will vote for Raila? Are we facing the spectre of a clear voting pattern of '40-against-2'?"", ' ', ""ENTER 'THE BRADLEY EFFECT'"", 'Oddly enough, there is nothing unusual about people saying to pollsters that they will vote for one candidate, and then turning round and voting for the rival candidate. It is actually quite common in an election where deep (but often unspoken) racial or communal rivalries exist, which is considered to be politically incorrect to discuss openly.', 'In the US, this is known as the Bradley Effect among political scientists as much as newspaper columnists.', 'In a 2012 article in The Daily Caller, political columnist Mickey Kaus explained, The Bradley Rule holds that voters will be reluctant to tell pollsters they are voting against an African-American for fear of being labelled racist. It allegedly hurt Tom Bradley in 1982 and Douglas Wilder in 1989.', 'Indeed, thanks to what happened to Doug Wilder (i.e. he too seemed to lead in the polls, but ended up losing) this phenomenon is sometimes called the Wilder Effect too. And it is always a consideration when there is a black candidate on the ballot, for a significant political office like governor or senator.', 'The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof noted in 2008, for example, that Democrats are wringing their hands in nervousness over the Bradley Effect, in which black candidates poll well but win fewer votes than expected. Thats usually attributed to voters lying about racism  telling pollsters theyre going to vote for a black when they actually plan to vote for a white  but some scholars believe it has less to do with lying than with unconscious racism that leaves voters with growing doubts that lead to a last-minute mind change in the voting booth. In any case, though, the Bradley Effect has been diminishing in recent years, and in many races disappeared.', ' ', 'WHAT DID MUTAHI NGUNYI MISS?', 'In the Kenyan context, what we are faced with at this time is not an election result which paints a completely different picture from that which the polls had led us to expect. Rather, it is a conflict between two narratives, based on more or less the same voter registration figures.', 'Nobody seriously doubts that the great majority of Kenyan voters tend to go along with a clear tribal preference, when it comes to presidential elections. So Mr Ngunyis point of departure  that the Kalenjin and the GEMA nations together amount to a huge basket of votes, is not in doubt.', 'The unanswered question though, is what has Mutahi Ngunyi missed? For if his projections were accurate, then there should be no question of a dead heat between Uhuru and Raila. It should have been equally obvious in the opinion polls, that Uhuru had a huge (though by no means insurmountable) lead. Or at the very least, the numbers given by the leading pollsters should vary so widely as to create serious doubts about their credibility.', 'One pollster may be wrong; but they cannot all be wrong. So how do you reconcile the pollsters being unanimous that this election is a dead heat, while Mutahi Ngunyis theory  and a very influential theory it is  argues that Uhuru Kenyatta has such a huge lead, that Raila cannot hope to catch him?', 'Just as the Amercian political scientists turned to psychology to explain what they thereafter termed as the Bradley Effect so too, must we now turn to psychology to explain this divergence between the two sets of statistics: Mutahi Ngunyis reliance on the registration numbers from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to project an unassailable lead for Uhuru Kenyatta; and the combined results of the reputable Kenyan pollsters, which suggest that either Uhuru or Raila could just as easily win, with Raila  at this point  having a slightly better chance of winning.', ' ', 'A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE IEBC NUMBERS', 'But before we even consider the psychological factors, we should note that the tyranny of numbers theory is based on just 62.4 per cent of the vote. That alone makes it suspect. If this theory were to be taken seriously as in any way reflecting final outcomes, it should at least have accounted for some 95 per cent of the vote, thus giving some indication as to why one candidate had effectively won already; and the other was doomed to fail.', 'In this case, there is a clear 37.6 per cent which is not accounted for. This is far too large a number to be referred to as a swing vote. The swing vote factor only comes in, when some 90 per cent or more of the vote has been accounted for.', 'Using yet another American example, here is an analysis published in 2001, in the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, and written by Jeffrey Helmreich. It is titled The Israel swing factor: how the American Jewish vote influences US elections and it made this argument:', 'There are two clashing myths on the political power of American Jewry. One claims that the community is too small to affect national elections; Jews make up less than three per cent of the US population. A contrasting view holds that US Jews play a disproportionately large role in national politics thanks to their campaign donations and media influence.', 'According to evidence confirmed in the most recent elections (2000) however, American Jewish voters maintain the potential to be the decisive factor in national election results. Yet, this ability does not emanate from any financial or public relations clout, which is overestimated. Rather, American Jews wield power through their high concentration in key states, and their tendency to behave as a swing vote in ways that set them apart from virtually all other groups in American politics.', 'So if a population as small as three per cent counts as a decisive swing vote in close elections, then how can any calculation that leaves out a clear 37 per cent of the vote  and confidently predicts a precise outcome from this calculation  possibly be taken seriously?', 'A different interpretation of the IEBC registration numbers then  when reconciled with the results of the opinion polls  may well be that most of the country is united against the Gema-Kalenjin political coalition that goes by the name Jubilee.', 'And that perhaps a significant number of Kalenjin and Gema community members, have also decided to vote against their tribal wave and support Raila Odinga instead. And that this claim of a solid 43 per cent of the vote having been locked in by the Jubilee coalition is a hoax, which will be exposed when the final tally is made.', ' ', 'A MATTER OF PSYCHOLOGY', 'There could be any number of reasons why the rest of the country might unite against Jubilee: it could be a growing awareness that the Jubilee candidates for president and deputy president will not be here to preside over anything if they should win; that they will have their hands full defending themselves at The Hague.', 'It could be a fear of economic sanctions, if the two refuse to obey the summons from The Hague.', 'It could be a simple sense of resentment that only those two communities  the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin  have ever had one of their own occupy State House, and so someone from some other tribe should now have an opportunity to lead the nation.', 'Or it could be that  contrary to appearances on the surface  there are many within the Kalenjin community who are not yet reconciled to voting for a Kikuyu presidential candidate, given the extreme bad blood between the two communities as revealed in the 2008 post-election violence.', 'It could be that when William Ruto gave up his own presidential ambitions to support Uhuru Kenyatta as his running-mate, he did not really take the entire Kalenjin vote with him, into the Jubilee coalition, much as the DPM Musalia Mudavadi evidently did not carry all of Western Kenya with him into the Amani Coalition.', 'This, of course, is what would be a classic example of the psychological phenomenon defined as the Bradley Effect: that the Kalenjin voters may currently appear to be reconciled to voting in a Kikuyu president; but then when they get to the ballot box, we will find that  owing to unresolved historical differences  they are, ultimately, not willing to do so.', 'In short, it may well be that the true tyranny of numbers"" will be expressed in a 57 per cent vote against Uhuru in the widely-anticipated runoff between him and Raila; that although he is a strong candidate with massive grassroots support in Central Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta will lose solely because it goes against the national sentiment to have a Kikuyu succeeding another Kikuyu to the presidency.', 'And it is to be noted that such a perspective does not argue that Mutahi Ngunyi cooked up those numbers from the IEBC. Those numbers  on the face of it  appear to be real enough. What is however revealed, is that Ngunyi had no real idea what those numbers signified; and that he lacked the sophistication to go beyond a simple tribal calculus, which in any case he based on less than 65 per cent of the total vote.', ' ', 'AN EMPTY HOAX', 'We can conclude then, that the tyranny of numbers narrative is little more than an empty hoax. The alleged starting point of the Jubilee Coalition is basically just the 43 per cent that all the polls estimate Uhuru Kenyatta will get. And the only tyranny possible, is that the rest of the Kenyan voters will unite to deny Uhuru victory in the second round of balloting.', 'The projection that Uhuru starts off with a huge numerical advantage is pure myth. That 43 per cent may actually represent the best that he can hope for. It is an end game number, not a starting point. And unless all the pollsters are wrong  despite having been right for the last five electoral events in Kenya  this presidential election is going into a runoff which distinctly favours Raila Odinga as the eventual winner ', '\n']"

My contention is that the best debater is not always the best leader.', 'To that extent, facilitators of the big debate have a misdemeanor to respond to. The best leaders world over distinguish themselves through character, consistency in pursuing moral threads in their politics and moral courage.', 'This is demonstrable. While the Biblical Moses easily stood out as charismatic in view of his history as a rebel to the pharaoh, a survivor in adversity and a messenger of God, being a stammerer, he would have fared miserably in a debate with his more articulate brother, Aaron. Moses relied on Aaron to address crowds due to this inadequacy.', 'The intellectual atmosphere engineered by the facilitators during the Monday presidential debate was substantially status quo fully fitted with cushions for those with moral leadership queries. Im referring to the facilitators glaring gaps in the choice of questions seemingly designed to save the faces of some candidates.', 'That aside, a number of other questions crossed my mind. I asked how possible it was for the facilitators to appreciate the historical achievement that the debate represented without giving the candidates a chance to state their individual input and sacrifice in the realisation of the same. Is it because Raila will be unmatched?', 'How can, for instance, Nelson Mandela hold a similar debate with presidential candidates from the Racist Boers (National Party) and a question on his special role in the liberation of South Africa does not feature?', 'Giving the debaters opportunity to tell Kenyans about their role in creating conducive space for such debates would have given people the chance to identify who among the candidates has the strengths of the inarticulate Biblical Moses compared to the sleek tongue of his inexperienced and not-so-tested younger brother, Aaron.', 'If this was the starting point for the debate, it would have separated job/fortune seekers, adventurers and those committed to a cause of service to society.', 'Dida, the impressive teacher would have nothing to say because despite being an adult, he has never featured anywhere at the nations moments of need. The fairly articulate man of attitude and authority Peter Kenneth, and Uhuru Kenyatta, the ultimate symbol of conservatism in Kenya, would have been humbled by their inability to present a single act of sacrifice in their entire history.', 'The facilitators were creatures of the status quo-yes, the one that keeps resisting reforms. What would have been wrong by beginning the debate by observing a minute of silence in memory of those who died struggling to create that occasion?', 'Julie Gichuru and Linus Kaikai may have drunk Mois milk (read young), but surely they are educated enough to know that Bishop Timothy Njoya, Gitobu Imanyara, John Khaminwa, Kepta Ombati (whose leg was broken by the GSU in reform campaigns in 1997) and the abandoned families of freedom fighters were watching the debate.', 'What harm is there in recognising that the debate is not manna from heaven but an expensive architectural design of men and women, majority of whom were not even literate while fighting for the realisation of this democratic goody?', 'As expected, all the candidates in different words projected themselves as social democrats through their social welfare agenda. Conservative capitalists know it is politically incorrect to proclaim themselves conservative or mere agents of international capital so they often package themselves as free market believers or social democrats.', 'It is amazing that while Raila Odinga was challenged to state his ideology (social democracy), Uhuru Kenyatta, the embodiment of ultra-capitalism, was left scot-free. Martha Karua cited Cuba, a communist country, to illustrate the viability of her version of social democracy but no facilitator pinned her down to that.', 'Had Raila cited socialist countries to strengthen his people first politics in the debate, I suspect the youthful facilitators would have accused him of being a communist.', 'The facilitators promised to bring the elephant into the room but I believe time and prejudice allowed in too small a fraction of it in. In the course of the interview, an ethnic pattern emerged on the ICC question which the facilitators consciously ignored.', 'I wonder how the debate on the ICC was concluded without asking Uhuru if he still maintains that Raila engineered their trip to The Hague.', 'About friendship between the two? The facilitators did not bother to interrogate further the claim by Uhuru to be friendly to Raila yet he is on record saying on national television that he has no problem with Luos except Raila who he described in his mother tongue as Kimundu.', 'While the spirit that drove the debate seems to be inculcating a culture of accommodation and tolerance for deviant views, it is clear that our first presidential debate failed to dig out critical leadership capacities because it allowed status quo presidential candidates to get away with historical baggage.

Uhuru could surprisingly ride this crest wave of rage in the slums of Nairobi.', 'For those in the diaspora following the evolving elections with consternation, what is shocking is that issue based fringe candidates like Peter Kenneth, Ole Kiyiapi and Martha Karua will be sacrificed at the alter of rising poverty and the ICC case.

In elections, voters could\nonly vote for Kanu leaders. The president, MPs and councilors were all\nelected from Kanu. Only Kanu's voice was heard in Parliament and it\ndutifully passed anything that Kanu president and government wanted.\nThese are the times to which some leaders are asking Kenyans to go back\nto. "", 'To ensure people wore the Kanu suit only, however dirty\nor tattered, all parties except Kanu were banned, forcing people to\nelect Kanu leaders only.', ' ', 'After banning other parties,\npeople could only vote for a Kanu suit of leadership whether they liked\nit or not. Rebels against Kanu suit were always taught a lesson by\nbeing cast into detention without trial to languish there for many\nyears. They were also banned from employment, farming and business. The\nmost unlucky were arrested, tortured and killed for opposing the Kanu\nsuit.', ' ', 'Kenyans were also forced to vote for certain Kanu\nleaders only. To ensure this, secret ballot was quashed and replaced\nwith open queue voting whose purpose was to intimidate voters to vote\nfor Kanu government favourites only. Any voter who dared queue behind a\ndissident or rebel would identify themselves for punishment as would\nany rebel candidate who offered to challenge a Kanu presidents\nfavourite.', ' ', 'Even then, when the rebel won, he was declared\nloser, as government losers were declared winners, a practice that was\nrecently witnessed in party primaries.', ' ', 'Suit voting is\nnot new in Kenya. As Kanus favourite voting system, Kenyans had a good\ntaste of its tyranny. Given Kenyans rejection of its dictatorship, it\nbaffles that some leaders are fighting for its restoration and use.\nConveniently, these leaders have forgotten that the disease that\nre-occurs is the one that kills and it is foolish to return a finger\nwhere it was once bitten. Strangely, suit voting is justified with\npropaganda of ethnic salvation.', ' ', 'Not to be naked after\nrejecting the Kanu suit, people also struggled for multiparty democracy\nthat was restored in 1992. Since, Kanu suit was no more legally\nenforced and Kenyans were free to pick, mix and wear outfits that were\noften smarter than Kanus tattered suit.', ' ', 'Despite this\nfreedom, there were leaders who sought to make Kenyans wear suits other\nthan that of Kanu. And there is the example of the Ford Asili suit in\n1992 that had devastating consequences of voting for some of Kenyas\nmost useless leaders. ', ' ', 'In 1998, there was also the DP\nsuit in Central province. Again it gave Kenya some of its worst and\nlazy leaders that disappeared almost immediately after elections.', ' ', 'In\nLuo Nyanza, there was the wave of the ODM suit that also gave Kenya\nsome of its most sycophantic leaders whose only loyalty was to the\nethnic chief. Thankfully, during the party nominations, we saw party\nelectorates bravely reject imposition of leaders from above in whatever\nname. Emphatically, Kenyans in Nyanza said no to suit voting and\nKenyans elsewhere are saying the same thing. From this, one hopes the\nKenyan Spring is just around the corner.', ' ', 'Suit voting is\nslavery that Kenyans seeking good leadership should avoid and reject\nlike leprosy. Just because party leaders prefer so, people should not\nelect candidates over whom they have not been consulted and are known\nto be thieves, crooks, clowns or useless. But as people reject bad\nleaders, they should also reject ethnic causes that justify them.\nIndeed, no reason can justify people electing candidates they dont\nknow imposed upon them from above in the name of suits that leaders\nhave picked for them. This is absolutely undemocratic and tyrannical.', ' ', 'Voting\nfor persons people know nothing about is playing the Russian roulette\nof putting a pistol to the head, gambling whether the trigger will or\nwill not release a bullet that will blow your mind away.

Other variables like level of education, gender and age can change voting dynamics. He says this is why pollsters publish the demographics they work with.', ""Ngunyi's Tyranny of Numbers did not have any reasonable demographics according to Handa. Besides, Handa says there are other ethnic blocs apart from the ones Ngunyi lumped together which will participate in the polls. He says in a democracy the principle of universal suffrage, one man one vote is key."", 'It did not have any demographics. It was based on one assumption that Kenya is made up of certain ethnic blocs which vote in certain ways, that assumption is wrong.', 'According to him, only a scientific poll can accurately predict results of an election that has not yet been held. He says by and large, scientific polls are credible to the extent in which they remain objective and in which they adhere to minimum research standards.', 'Any body set about to do serious research who gets the correct sample size, distributes it appropriately, frames questions properly and does proper data analysis will get results close as possible to what voters will actually vote.', 'Asked about lack of credibility arising from pollsters use of census results as opposed to voters register demographics, Handa concedes that ideally, the frame ought to be registered voters. He however says in the absence of updated voters register, the next available frame would be the population census because it shows the proportion of Kenyans who are 18 and above.', 'And its a close, good indication of voter figures. That is why IEBC uses the population census to estimate the number of people who should be registered in particular regions. We may not have the updated voter demographics but we know we have 14 million voters and we know where they are, he said.', 'He said although opinion polls have chances of biases here and there, this is catered for in the margin or error calculation. The margin of error is calculated on the basis of possibilities of questions not being framed properly, missing data and the way questions are put among others.', 'Asked to give tyranny of numbers a margin of error, Handa said: There is nothing like margin of error in that thing. That thing was not scientific. Even historically speaking I think it was wrong. He has not even come out to defend it.', 'Wolf who is traditionally associated with Ipsos Synovate group is opposed to tyranny of numbers right from its framing. He says tyranny suggests somebody is being oppressed and yet in a democracy numbers, any numbers or even a number matter.', 'For him the correct phrases to use is safety of numbers or importance of numbers.', 'Yes it is true certain ethnic groups are larger than others and therefore candidates from those groups may have some advantage than others. Fortunately, there is no single ethnic group in Kenya that approaches a quarter of the population, he says.', 'On this basis, Kenya would never suffer the tragedy of Rwanda- polarisation of two large groups. The safety of the Kenyan numbers is that no ethnic group on its own can ever aspire through the vote to achieve dominance.', ""Wolf also challenges Ngunyi's assumption that certain communities would vote for their presidential candidates man-to-man and woman-to-woman."", ""We know from our survey data that there is no ethnic group in this country which is 100 per cent united behind their candidates. Within every ethnic group there are free thinkers, deviants and independent minds. It's false and misleading to make such a blanket assumption, he says."", 'He says the best example is UDF presidential candidate Musalia Mudavadi. Three opinion polls have in the recent past showed that he is not the leading presidential candidate in Western and in his Luhya tribe.', 'And so for him, scientific polls are the only credible means of crunching numbers. He admits that polls have statistical margin of error. He said there are also other issues such as excluding non English and non-Swahili speakers from the polls with the risk of creating a bias.', 'There are also other issues like respondents lying. The main weakness for voter intention surveys is voter turn out, he says. Although its very rare that voter turn out is rarely likely to go below 65 per cent and beyond 75 per cent, poll results reflect an extraordinarily higher results than this.', 'According to Wolf, the past record of pollsters in the country however bails pollsters out of these credibility issues.', 'Going back to 1997 election, the only company that was polling, Strategic PR, got it basically right that Moi would be re-elected but with a smaller margin than 1992. They were outside margin of error but not by much, he says.', 'He says ever since and starting in 2002 elections when many pollsters joined the business of polling, all the pollsters always got it right but sometimes with minimal deviations from the margins of error.', 'Wolf is also ready to concede on one thing; that pollsters are challenged by closely called polls. No pollster can predict the results in a very closely called election because candidates can be defeated by 1 vote or even 100 votes.', 'The closer the election, the more likely it is that pollsters cannot produce any prediction. And they should say so. I was widely quoted in the last election saying it was too close to call. And up to now, no one know who won that election.', 'He say the real safety of numbers is in many pollsters doing the same thing so that comparisons can be made across them. He says this should and include the possibility of doing a poll of polls.', ""Like Handa, Wolf cannot give any margin of error to Ngunyi's figures because there was no sample used. He says Ngunyi did not even check past voting trends in each tribal bloc."", 'So yes, lets look at the importance of numbers but lets not worship them and give them an importance that goes beyond their meaning at least as shown in an empirical research, he says, signing off.', '\n']"

These are; their quest is not about democracy and neither is it about giving Kenyans a choice at the polls. Yet, the two have somewhat duped a lot of people into believing their quest is about democracy and giving Kenyans a choice at the polls.', 'Indeed, notwithstanding the serious crimes against humanity Uhuru faces, during the presidential debate, Uhuru likened what he faces to ordinary challenges Kenyans face on a day to day basis. He went further and said those who support him have already given him a pass on these serious charges, claiming they know all about the charges but still support him.', 'Uhuru confidently went on to surmise that if Kenyans elect him, they will have shown confidence that [he] will do the job. This assertion is wrong in several ways.', 'To begin with, what Uhuru faces are not ordinary challenges Kenyans experience on a day to day basis. To say the truth, Uhuru seems not to have taken the case he faces seriously.', 'This in turn helps explain the nonchalant and dismissive attitude displayed by Uhuru and Ruto whenever they discuss the ICC. They often dismiss the whole process as inconsequential while at times pretending to be ready to prove [their] innocence.', 'Uhuru and Ruto are charged with being responsible for the murder of more than 1,300 people in addition to rapes, maiming, destruction of property and displacement of more than 600,000 innocent Kenyans.', 'These are not ordinary challenges Kenyans face on a day to day basis. These are very serious criminal charges Uhuru and Ruto must take very seriously in defending rather than hedging their bets on winning the presidency and thereby defying the ICC. This will have dire consequences for the entire country.', 'Indeed, it is a fact that one facing charges involving murder would never ordinarily be free pending trial, yet the ICC gave Uhuru and Ruto special consideration in allowing them to remain free pending trial.', 'Instead of using this freedom to prepare for their cases, Uhuru and Ruto have instead opted to vie for the presidency and vice presidency as though these charges mean nothing to them.', 'That may be the case in their minds and those they have managed to pull wool over their heads but one would have to conclude a majority of those going to the polls on March 4, 2013 would have to disagree.', 'The duo is also disingenuous and, quite frankly, dishonest when they claim that their quest for the presidency is about democracy and giving people a choice at the polls,', 'This is about the two of them and an ambitious ploy to gain the presidency in the hope of either thwarting or altogether defying the ICC.', 'Their hiding behind democracy must be exposed.', 'The world is replete with examples of despotic dictators who often command 80-90 per cent of coerced votes cast yet they claim to be democratic. People like Saddam Hussain come to mind.', 'One of the reasons these despots succeed in coercing such massive numbers of votes is often because it doesnt take much convincing of their own tribes to vote for them, even as these very tribesmen and women know these are despots better suited for the hanging chambers for their crimes of genocide. But human nature being the way it is, tribalism tends to be more easily exploited than rejection of such exploitation.', 'It took the decisive force of the United States and other allies to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Saddams trial, conviction and hanging for the genocide of his people was perhaps the last writing on the wall. As civilised nations, we cannot allow those suspected of committing such heinous crimes to do so at will and without accountability regardless of whether they find refuge in their clans or tribes.', 'The needs and rights of a nation are greater and far more outweigh the needs or rights of a single individual.', 'The fact is, much as Saddam Husseins tribe supported him even long after he was tried, convicted and hanged, for committing genocide, much the same way you can expect anyone charged at the ICC for genocide to count on their tribe no matter what the evidence or outcome.', 'Thats just a fact of life.', 'However, it is unacceptable to turn around and point to that virtually guaranteed support and say, to hell with justice and post-election violence victims.', 'If Uhuru and Ruto are elected, it would be virtually on account of a majority of two tribes coming together and massively voting for them. But unlike in the past where this has happened whether people like it or not and without any consequences save for post-election violence, the consequences of electing ICC indictees will be dire. It behooves every voter, especially those sitting on the fence to think very seriously and do the necessary to avoid such an eventuality.', 'Just as its not about democracy for Uhuru and Ruto to be on the ballot, its not true as Uhuru claimed during the debate that by electing him, Kenyans would have passed a vote of confidence that he can do the job.', 'As noted above, people often support their own leaders regardless of what they have done simply because they are their own. It amounts to selfishness to exploit this human weakness to seek high office.', 'Uhuru can do the right thing and step-aside rather than selfishly pursue the presidency. Meanwhile the majority of Kenyans going to polls on March 4 should show the rest of the world that Kenyans know better than to put themselves in such a precarious position.', '\n']"

Those of us who use their (industry captains) instruments to spread ethnic hate and divide the organisations we work in, where we get our daily bread from and support our families and for the politicians who use the same to divide the nation, yet trumpet their lofty manifestos without thinking twice about where the money (read taxes) will come from to operate should they not save-guard the economy. People asking for 50 bob dont contribute to the taxes that power government  we do. ', 'In 2010 as we geared up to the referendum, two voices stood out for me. One was that of Michael Joseph who not only asked his staff to register and had the then IIEC set up registration desks at Safaricom HQ1, but he also took 10 minutes of his time to get onto the Big Breakfast and urge the rest of us and his peers to ensure we registered and took part in the referendum. ', 'The other voice that stood out was that of Dr James Mwangi who did pretty much the same thing. Today, Kenya Private Sector Alliance is at the forefront of ensuring we all reclaim our country with the Mkenya Daima initiative  however, I want more. How much more? Let me explain. ', ""Should business leaders be political? Let me rephrase  should business leaders be involved in politics? There is a difference, and it's not just a semantic one. As Kenyans who make big decisions that have big impact, leaders in business across the board have over the years developed a sort of allergy to the idea of a CEO getting into policy-shaping. And yet business leaders are finding themselves drawn into the political process  oddly enough, to try and depoliticise it. "", ""In 2012, in the lead up to the US presidential elections, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz both expressed concerns about America's current level of partisanship, and what such ideological gridlock could do to the economy. How is that any different from what we are going through here in Kenya and the fact that tribal and divisive politics endangers how we work and function and whether the people we employ can continue to co-exist peacefully.

Since it will happen well after I have submitted this column, I can only hope other captains of industry and business leaders can enjoin their voices to her's and Vimals and call for sanity as we go into the March 4 elections and beyond. "", ""So why do we feel so uncomfortable with the worlds of business and politics colliding? Its a blowback that Howard Schultz says he gets from worried board members and shareholders. But I think it's time to recognise that being involved in policy is not the same thing as being partisan. Getting off the sidelines is not the same thing as choosing sides. Let me say that again for emphasis: Getting off the sidelines is not the same thing as choosing sides.

As managers who work here, we take our cue from them.

Yes, if you wish to be myopic, Kiprono is Kalenjin, Wachira is Kikuyu. However, their commitment to a working, growing economy cant be dismissed or argued away.

Firstly there are fewer elephants, and secondly the demand for ivory is far higher. Record ivory prices in the Far East are fuelling poachers, organised crime and political instability right across the African elephant range. And the situation shows no sign of calming.', 'In January last year, Janjaweed militia gunned down more than 300 elephants in Bouba NDjida National Park in Cameroon. In March, 22 elephants in Garamba National Park, DRC, were slaughtered in a single attack, many with shots to the top of the head. A Ugandan army helicopter was seen flying low-level over the park a few days after.', 'In December 2012, an illegal shipment of six tonnes of poached ivory was seized in Malaysia, one of the largest such hauls in recent history. Over the last decade Zakouma National Park in Chad has lost 90 per cent of its elephants.', 'As if we needed more evidence of the dire situation, at the time of writing news arrived from our study area in Northern Kenya that three adult elephants have been found dead in a pile near Isiolo, evidence that experienced gunmen are at work. ', 'Littered around that valley were at least 20 more fresh carcasses. This well-monitored elephant population has suffered higher levels of illegal killing in 2012 than in any other year on record.', 'Over the past few years wildlife trafficking has become more organised, more lucrative, more widespread, and more dangerous than ever before, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently warned a meeting of Washingtons diplomatic community. The situation has become an issue of both national and economic security for nations across Africa, she added.', 'The ivory trade is the greatest threat to elephants, one that threatens to wipe them from the wilds of Africa and Asia long before they disappear beneath mans ever-expanding footprint. ', 'Behind the many facets of the current crisis is the swelling demand for ivory. The race is on to convince Chinas affluent middle class of the terrible impacts of buying ivory before elephants succumb to the unbridled desire for their tusks.', 'Elephant populations across Africa have been falling like dominoes. The once-widespread elephants of West Africa  such as the fabled herds of the Ivory Coast  disappeared into tiny, isolated pockets long ago. Central Africas elephants seemed more secure as recently as the 1980s when they were thought to comprise more than half of the continents population and to be a vast repository that could withstand an ivory trade indefinitely.', 'It took years for scientists to penetrate the forests and accumulate reliable facts on the elusive forest elephants that inhabit them. Populations there had entered a steep decline which I believe started in the 1970s. ', 'By the first decade of the 21st Century vast areas of forest had been emptied of elephants. Their range has now shrunk to a tiny fraction of its previous extent, and the animals that remain are under acute threat. ', 'Notorious armed groups like Darfurs Janjaweed and the Lords Resistance Army are funding their operations by preying on the few survivors. The Central African domino has toppled.', 'With this central reserve of elephants gone, the rising demand for ivory can only be sated by poachers turning to the remaining populations in East and Southern Africa.', 'The deep south of Southern Africa  Botswana, Namibia and South Africa itself  has long escaped the poaching problem thanks to their relative wealth and their well-financed wildlife departments. Their elephant populations are still the most secure, but with ivory now an established commodity for organised crime that may yet change, and reports of substantial ivory poaching are beginning to come from Botswana.', 'As evidenced by recent seizures, even sleepy Cape Town is now seen as a soft option for ivory traffickers, and the authorities of the Kruger National Park, having suffered a devastating and unexpected assault on rhinos, are now bracing for a similar attack on elephants. Unless demand is lowered, all that stands between Southern Africa and an ivory poaching onslaught are the elephants of East Africa.', 'Here the battle is in full spate. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species monitoring of elephants has shown that nine out of 10 major East African Protected areas showed record levels of illegal killing in 2011. Most of the illegal ivory seized in large-scale shipments in the past three years originated in Kenya and Tanzania.', 'One of Africas best-studied elephant populations is in the Samburu District, north Kenya, where the fate of individually known elephants has been a particularly sensitive barometer of trouble. ', 'Elephants are safe and very tame and trusting within the national reserves of Samburu and Buffalo Springs, but they often leave this highly protected haven and move into dangerous areas outside. ', 'First the large bulls disappeared, targeted for their ivory. Sometimes the bodies were found, but mostly we have simply seen their numbers dwindle away. Currently females outnumber the bulls by two to one, but they are now being killed and one fifth of the families have no mature females left to lead them.', 'It looks as if 2012 will turn out to have been the worst year weve recorded for elephant poaching in the Northern Kenya area. The actual number of elephants killed per day across the continent is difficult to estimate. ', 'On the assumption that their populations are still much as they were estimated in 2007, and that natural mortality is within normal limits, then as many as 100 elephants killed per day is an easily believable figure, despite more boots and guns being deployed in their defence than ever before.', 'In the coming months elephants and their ivory will be increasingly in the news. Cites is holding its 16th Conference of Parties in Bangkok in March. Those with an interest in the future of elephants will potentially be riven by a fundamental argument between those who believe in a sustained ivory trade, and those who opt for a complete trade ban.', 'We must break the deadlock and find consensus, rather than division. There is cause for common ground in a new conservation paradigm that recognises that the current demand for ivory exceeds the possible supply of elephants, and that demand needs to be reduced if elephants are to survive.', 'If concerned individuals, NGOs, institutions and governments can hold to this understanding it could lead to united international action to lower the demand for ivory. Whatever our point of view, this is crucial for the long-term survival of elephants.', ""We don't yet have all the facts we need to understand the relationship between ivory supply and demand to make all the judgments, but we have been through intensive elephant killing before and history can teach us some lessons. "", 'It is true that in the 20th century in the colonial and immediately post colonial era some East African Game Departments were substantially funded by legal ivory sales, but that world has gone forever. At present any call for re-opening a well regulated legal trade is utopian and unrealistic.', 'Corruption, mismanagement, weak penalties for wildlife crime and a lack of political will to change things mean that too often poachers have the upper hand. The 20 years after the 1989 ivory trade ban were accompanied by recovery of elephant populations, particularly in East Africa. Thanks to the ban and widespread outrage in the media, ivory became unfashionable and almost all the key populations in the region recovered from the excessive illegal killing of the former epoch.', 'Increasing numbers were seen in aerial counts and the ratio of carcasses to live elephants diminished. In most protected areas law enforcement was adequate enough to allow elephant populations to grow through the 1990s and early 2000s even in areas where poaching was at a moderate level.', 'The Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants programme, put in place by Cites with input from independent scientists and the African Elephant Specialist group, picked up on the Central African declines early. ', 'In 2011 the alarm bells finally began ringing loud and clear that illegal killing was not sustainable in all four regions of Africa. For Samburu the tipping point appears to have come in 2008 when the price of ivory surged yet again. The current level of killing is unsustainable.', ""If it continues unchecked we will lose most of Africa's wild elephants. Under these circumstances it is a moment of wisdom that Tanzanias proposal to sell its ivory, the only one that was on the table, was gently withdrawn before it engendered polarisation on the familiar lines usually seen at Cites conferences. "", 'The desperate situation of the elephants in that country and the inability of the government to monitor or control illegal killing made the proposal for one-off sales of an ivory stockpiles seem doubly untenable.', 'However, the claim of such countries that they desperately need money for elephant conservation and protection is true and there is a need for new strategic thinking. In particular there is a need to explore how to deal with large stockpiles of ivory. ', 'They cannot be traded and ideally should be destroyed, but new money must come to help those countries. Forty years ago, in the first pan-African onslaught on elephants, the surge in poaching was driven by newly wealthy Japanese buying ivory totems.', ""Demand for ivory still exists across the Far East, but today it is the booming economy of the world's most populous nation that makes China a black hole with the power to suck in all elephants in only a few short years."", 'Our own NGO, Save The Elephants, is one of many that are reaching out to the people of China. Last year, with our talented and visionary partners WildAid, we brought to Kenya one of their most influential celebrities, basketball player Yao Ming where he was received by KWS. In 2013 we will broadcast hard-hitting campaign advertisements in China to highlight the impacts of buying illegal ivory. ', 'Yaos emotional response to living, breathing, playing elephants and to horrific faceless carcasses revealed the powerful commonality of human responses and awareness needed to save elephants.', 'The few remaining elephants in China are revered and highly protected, as we learnt when we visited Xishuangbanna two years ago. When a Chinese delegation paid us a return visit, they too were shocked at the sight of poached elephants and were delighted by the living herds. ', ""Helping China to realise that Africa's elephants are just as worthy as their own is not only possible, it is happening."", 'The speech by Hillary Clinton signaled an unprecedented new political awareness in Washington about elephants and other wildlife. She promised US intelligence assets to help fight the chaos and organised crime. ', 'New technologies must be used to their full, but so too should existing ones, such as the DNA tracking of tusks, whose potential has been proved but which has been very slow to be properly implemented. Low-tech solutions can be just as useful, as shown by the success of the community conservation movement in the north of Kenya and in Namibia.', 'The root of the problemme lies in excessive ivory can be changed, as it was both in the West and in Japan. But such shifts take time, and awareness of what is happening to elephants must rapidly be shared in ivory consumer countries in the East. If it is not, elephants will not survive even at their current reduced levels.', ""The clock is ticking. A coalition of the willing is needed to help change come faster. To paraphrase Clinton, elephants cannot be manufactured. Once they're gone, they cannot be replaced. "", 'We must tackle the demand for ivory. If we do not elephant massacres like those of the two Congos, Cameroon, Chad and Kenya will be repeated, over the coming months and years, intensifying and spreading deeper into areas previously seen as safe. ', 'No amount of seizures and arrests on their own will be able to stem the tide of death that threatens Africas elephants.', ' ', '- This article was first published in Swara magazine', '\n']"

It is a breeding ground for vultures and eagles. Kenyas geothermal power is sourced here.', 'Hells Gate is the only park in the country where tourists can drive, walk and ride on bicycles. It is famed for its annual wheelbarrow race.', 'Gazetted in 1984, the park which has consistently attracted large numbers of domestic and foreign tourists could soon have its beauty reversed, environmentalists and tour operators warn. This is because more geothermal wells are being sunk by the national power producer, Kengen, in an effort to increase electricity production in the country.', 'Kengen has embarked on the construction of the largest geothermal project as the country moves to initiate green energy projects to cut its dependence on hydro and thermal power.', 'The company currently owns and operates two geothermal power stations at Olkaria namely Olkaria I and Olkaria II.', 'Olkaria IV plant is being put up by a consortium of Japanese firm Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Hyundai Engineering and Construction from South Korea, and is scheduled for completion early next year. But environmentalists are against the project, saying massive destruction of the vegetation would affect wildlife in the park.', 'It is saddening that we are witnessing the ongoing geothermal activity in Hells Gate which violates our national park regulations and is another example of how our parks are becoming the dispersal areas not for wildlife but for development, says Paula Kahumbu who heads WildlifeDirect, a non-governmental organisation providing support to conservationists. It is a shame that this kind of destruction is going on right in one of Kenyas most important vulture breeding areas.', 'While not against the production of geothermal in Olkaria, Kahumbu warns that the ongoing human activities at the park could render some birds like the eagle and vultures extinct.', 'I am shocked that the developers and KWS do not see the contradiction that geothermal energy development is for this tiny spectacular park, she says, this could see the end of eagles and vultures whose breeding place is at the park.', 'She said the government had not released the Environmental Impact Assessment report carried out by the National Environment Management Authority for public scrutiny.', 'She accused KWS of having approved the drilling of more wells in the park instead of protecting it. KWS is mandated to manage and protect parks and not expected to approve this kind of exploitation which threatens the very natural resource that Kenyans gave up for public enjoyment.', 'A visit by the Star recently established that the park is dusty and noisy as heavy vehicles ferried construction materials to Olkaria IV site.', 'Our team saw movement of heavy machinery and dust covering the park as tour guides said wild animals are no longer easily visible like before. Many trees have been cut down to pave way for new roads. A new tarmac road is being laid to Olkaria IV.', 'KWS said it is aware of the negative impacts of the project especially on wildlife and birds. It is true some activities being undertaken in Hells Gate National Park are having negative impacts on wildlife especially birds, said KWS spokesman Paul Mbugua in an email. Both Kenya Wildlife Service and Kengen are aware of the matter and are committed to addressing it.', 'He said the agencies are therefore engaging each other with a view of finding solutions to the problems. KWS is holding several meetings this week (last week) on the same. I suggest I give you answers to your questions early next week, said Mbugua.', 'By the time of going to press yesterday, no comment had been received from KWS.', 'Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act (Cap 376) prohibits cutting any vegetation in a national park, or clearing, cultivating or breaking up for cultivation any land in a national park.', 'However, Kengen said it had met all environmental requirements before drilling the wells. Everything is in order, says Kaara Wainaina, Kengens corporate communications officer. Before any project is done we have to consult Nema and present our environmental impact assessment and this has been done in all our projects.', 'He said to cushion the rising demand for power in the country, Kengen is doing all at its disposal to ensure that the demand which is rising by 10 per cent a year is met.', 'We have a memorandum with KWS and Nema, he said.', 'He said the project is being funded by international organisations like World Bank and Japan International Corporation which shows that the project had been approved by all relevant authorities.', 'According to the Vision 2030 blueprint, the country has estimated the national peak demand for electricity in the country will be approximately 3,141MW by the year 2014 and approximately 17,000MW by the year 2030.', 'There is also a very well thought out plan on how the management of the waste is done, said Kaara. We did an Environmental Impact Assessment and presented it to Nema who gave us the green light to continue... some of the concerns raised here are what Nema are really concerned about and we factored everything here.', 'The chairman of Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers Ken Korir says the human activities going on in the park are not good for tourism.', 'Korir, who is also the lodge manager, Sarova Hotels, says more geothermal wells could have a very negative impact on the park.', 'We have to come out and set our priorities right. We are seeing a situation whereby the government is turning a blind eye to environmental degradation. Tourism has been the main foreign exchange earner and if we do not look into this matters well, we will lose our tourism, he said.', 'Tourism earnings last year was Sh98 billion, according to the Kenya Tourism Board, a figure Korir says could drop significantly if KWS does not reconsider its stand in parks like Hells Gate.', 'He says an example is the planned bypass that is set to cut through Lake Nakuru National Park which has been approved by the government in disregard of advice from conservationists.', 'There will be a massive migration of birds in Hells Gate, he says. What we are yet to understand is how KWS and Nema allowed such construction in the park.', 'According to him, it would take a long time for the birds and animals to adapt to the noise and the dust in the park.', 'The Kenya Tourism Board refused to be drawn into the matter, saying it was an issue to be tackled by KWS and Nema.', 'KWS and Nema are the best placed to handle this issue, said Kimutai Ngeno, assistant PR manager at KTB. I cannot comment on it.', 'The 140MW geothermal plant is also expected to negatively affect the community living in the area through noise and emissions.', 'Olkaria geothermal field is subdivided into sectors that include Olkaria East (Olkaria I), Olkaria Northeast (Olkaria II),Olkaria West (Olkaria III) and Olkaria Domes (Olkaria IV) where construction is going on now.', 'A report obtained by the Star established that Gibb Africa Ltd undertook the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment study for the Olkaria IV Power Station in 2009 and developed a Resettlement Action Plan for people living near the park and was approved by Nema.', 'Already a 1,700-acre piece of land has been identified to settle people living near domes area in Olkaria and is owned by Kedong Ranch Ltd. The infrastructure to be provided includes access roads, modern houses, a modern school, a social hall, a community water supply system, a cultural centre and churches.', 'Kahumbu says there is need to examine the engagements between KWS and Kengen and the companies that are operating in Hells Gate. We want Nema to take up her role of being the environmental watchdog and conduct a site assessment and blocking any further drilling until the entire debacle is fully investigated, she said.', 'We are seeking the original EIA and environmental license to find out if these wells are in compliance with Environmental and Management Co-ordination Act.', '\n']"

When buying land with the intention of developing it in future, it is important to seek clarification with the areas local authority first so as to find what is allowed for built areas in that location.', ' ', 'In Nairobi, for example, the City Council of Nairobi allows for only one single family house on half-acre plots in upmarket estates such as Runda, Muthaiga and Karen. The same local authority does allow subdivision of land to a minimum eighth-acre in areas where the number of family units can be increased. That is, allowing high-density buildings such as apartments.', 'Topography', ' ', 'Land on sloppy areas, such as at RedHill or Muranga, poses a challenge when it comes to laying down the foundation. Such areas require a lot of excavation and need soil-restraining walls. If the cost is not captured in the budget, then this could lead to project cost overruns.', ' ', 'However, slopes have the advantage of being well-drained compared to flat areas such as Ruai, Mombasa Road, South B and C. Flat areas tend to flood in heavy rains, and because of very low water tables, the foundation is usually more expensive, such as in places like Runda and Membley in Ruiru.', ' ', 'It is important to look out for physical presence of temporary water bodies such as streams, rivers and lakes because such areas risk floods when the rivers or streams break their banks. Presence of papyrus reeds and long grass may signify periods of flooding. Dry valleys may be proof of temporary rivers.', ' ', 'Narok and Naivasha towns are a good example of flat land that is prone to flooding in rainy seasons. In these areas, ground floor slab should be higher than ground level.', 'Soils', ' ', 'Constructing on Black Cotton soil presents unique challenges. These soils tend to swell when it rains and contract in dry seasons. This expansion and contraction can push the floor slab upward or downward, creating cracks on it. This requires deeper overhangs and wider external pavements to ensure rain water is kept off the building. Heavy gauge polythene will be requisite to waterproof the soil from the interior. A minimum depth of one foot for hardcore will serve to soak in water and keep the soil dry.', ' ', 'Red soil is stable and does not change in volume when wet or dry hence will cost less to construct on it.', ' ', 'So, if the contractor uses some ingenuity, he or she would save a lot on costs. Simple solutions such as lifting the slab slightly higher from ground level, waterproofing the soil in the foundation and increasing the cement ratio on the ground floor slab can save what would otherwise be spent on excavation and backfilling the foundation.', '\n']"

It needs a tried and tested leader. Not two apprentices of the Likoni Ferry type  accidents waiting to happen. And further distracted by their personal problems. I endorse Raila Odinga for President and urge that he be supported at the polls on election day.', 'There are three key issues  implementation of the constitution, reform (not just of laws but also of values in government and society) and devolution. There are three key qualifications  a track record, sacrifice, consciousness of the ethos of the new constitution.', 'I consider that on these critical issues and these critical qualifications Raila emerges as the candidate most to be trusted to implement the new Constitution fully and within its prescribed time frame. And his main opponent is the least trustworthy on each of these three issues.', 'Constitutions do not come into being of their own. They do not just happen. Raila is the one who has brought about the new Constitution. In 2000, it was Raila, not Moi, who brought KANU to the constitutional review process and facilitated Prof.Ghais chairmanship of the process. ', 'After Moi dissolved Parliament in 2002 and halted the process, Raila revived it in 2003 and brought about Bomas. He did not walk out of Bomas, like Kiraitu and others. When Bomas was ended without its recommended Constitution, and a fraudulent substitute put to the country, Raila led the country in the Referendum of 2005 to reject it. ', 'Raila was dropped from the Cabinet. After the 2007 PEV and the 2008 National Coalition, Raila again put constitutional review on Agenda IV. Raila and Kibaki then brought the Review law to Parliament in 2008, pushed the process through its many steps and campaigned the Referendum of 2010 to victory. Railas culminating point after 12 years of moving constitutional reform was the Promulgation on 27 August 2010.', 'This is the candidate who will best defend and apply the Constitution towards protection of the weak. No candidate can guarantee every right or fulfil every promise. ', 'But Raila is the most experienced and able candidate in this election. This is shown by his purpose in the years he suffered. That purpose was others, not himself. Such suffering does not bring a person wealth. It was done out of a nationalist conviction. What nationalist or political conviction does any deed of Uhuru show us? None comes to mind. ', 'This absence is also shown by his quick readiness to hand over the country to Ruto to run. Yet all Kenyans know that Ruto is against the Constitution, and that Kenyans in 2010 expressly and overwhelmingly rejected Rutos stand. ', 'This is how persons without strong or any political convictions approach high political office. The vacuum in Uhurus beliefs and convictions will soon translate into a vacuum of power in government. This will then be swiftly filled by the exclusive ethnic elites in the Civil Service and ethnobusinesses pushing now for his election. This, and therefore Uhuru and Ruto, are I believe a major danger to Kenya.', 'In contrast, Railas persistence over 30 years on behalf of the people of Kenya has earned him respect from crowds in every part of the country. He was the motor in the elections team of FORD-Kenya in 1992, when FORD-Kenya emerged as the only political party to win a seat in every province of Kenya. ', 'Raila has sacrificed for the country, and tested his ideas for the country. Firstly, through his detention, torture, prison and exile in the 1980s and 1990s. Secondly, through his sacrifice in placing Kenya above himself, giving up his 2007 election victory and agreeing in 2008 to come in on a National Coalition in the national interest.', 'It is Raila who has brought us to 2013 in a manner that is still holding Kenya together. Not Uhuru nor TNA nor their shadowy backers. Railas huge efforts to this end contrast with the failure of the same type arrangement in Zimbabwe. And show what we owe him.', 'What has Uhuru sacrificed for Kenya that enables him to claim the best right to prescribe for its future? Uhuru parrots only one answer : that it is his democratic right to stand. ', 'Not any special fitness, experience or qualification. Nor has he grasped the irony that his democratic right to stand in a multi-party election was brought about by Raila and others and not by himself! ', 'Uhurus standing with KANU in 2002 when he had kept mum throughout the Nyayo KANU years while fellow Kenyans were suffering greatly, showed that he was for the status quo and was not a man for reform. This is what Uhuru still is, though the new Constitution is for change and reform, of both structures and values.', 'Uhuru now pretends that he is for the poor, offering Waititu over the able Jimnah Mbaru. Raila shows that you can be for the poor and others, and still be experienced in administration and government and still respect everybody. ', 'Uhuru has not been for the poor at any time before this. Raila has been for the poor in Langata for the past 20 years as MP, and for them for 30 years through prison, detention and exile. Railas has not been a Luo seat but a Kenyan seat containing all Kenyans. He did not hide in a safe seat, like Bondo, or Gatundu.', 'Uhurus is not the party of the poor. Not with launching a manifesto for the poor with American -style expenditure, music, lights, flags and confetti. Nor is TNA the party of the middle class. The Middle Class are protected and assured growth through rights, only through an implemented Constitution.', 'I believe Raila is the most reliable candidate to complete that necessary constitutional process.

To commemorate this important milestone, the Star is publishing the untold stories of Kenya's clamour for independence which will culminate in the national celebrations on December 12. In the second edition in this series, read about how colonial askaris borrowed natives' wives at the Coast"", 'During the colonial era, native Coast people were lorded over by the British colonial rulers and the Mazrui Arabs under the Sultan of Zanzibar. And both these masters treated the natives like slaves.', 'But it was in the land of the Giriama that in the early part of the last century, a courageous woman leader known as Mekatilili wa Menza led the first organised opposition against the British rule following the capture of her brother by Arab slave traders. ', 'This led to the Giriama Uprising of 1913-14 at Chakama in Malindi, whose climax was the opposition of recruitment of the Giriama into the British carrier corps during the First World War.', 'For her sins, the British banished Mekatilili to detention in Kisii for five years, but legend has it that she miraculously escaped jail after only five months and returned home where she continued with the opposition to the British rule. The British and the Arabs however continued to lord it over the Giriama and Coast natives for the better part of a half century.', 'In 1954, Mzee Katana Shutu Masha, then a young man of 15 years was taken from his home in Malindi and forcibly made to work without pay as a messenger in the district officers office. Here he alternately served two masters  the British colonial administration and the Mazrui Arabs.', 'I would push files daily between the DOs office and that of the representative of the Sultan and at times was even forced to take a basket of mangoes from town to the airport, a journey of about 10km on foot, sometimes three times a day. The mangoes that would be flown to Nairobi were a gift of the Sultans men to the colonial governor.', 'Despite the scorching sun and the sharp rocks on the road that badly blistered the feet, the servants of the British and the Arabs were neither allowed to wear shoes nor long trousers. Our uniform consisted of khaki shorts and a long khaki shirt.', 'Katana and the other natives were forced to address their masters and mistresses as Bwana and Memsahib and if they made the slightest blunder however innocent, an askari kanga (administration policeman) would be instructed by the British DO to administer several strokes of the cane on their bare backs.', 'He recalls how the only vehicle that operated between Mombasa and Malindi simply known as Posta (my guess is it belonged to the Postal Corporation) had segregated compartments partitioned with wire mesh. The natives, who would ride in the rear compartment, had to be disinfected before boarding.', 'After four years of forced pro bono work Katana was formally employed, started earning a salary and with it came the payment of GPT. On going home, an elder commissioned by the British would determine your age by the hair on your armpit, which graduated you into a tax payer whether you were employed or not. Then like a slave you were forced to hang a metal disk on your neck, as testimony of your tax compliance.', 'But maybe the worst thing that happened to the Giriama people in that era, according to Katana, was the borrowing of peoples wives by the administration police officers.', ' If there were ten officers in a station, the headman would come to the village and order ten wives of the villagers to go and become wives to the askaris and tidy up their camp. You would be told openly that your wife was going to entertain the askaris and do domestic chores for them for seven days and your meek answer was simply, Ndiyo Bwana (yes, sir).', 'After the seven days, the women would be taken back to their homes and another headman from another village would provide the next set of women for the askaris. ', 'We also suffered further humiliation from the askaris who would at leisure pluck us from our matrimonial homes at the crack of dawn, demanding prove that we had paid GPT. They would then in the fashion of the previous centurys slave trade, tie a group of ten of us together on the waist and in that difficult position, force us to sing and dance for them.', 'The culprits would later be taken to the DOs office and then to the liwali (a fat Arab magistrate) who would clown, Mwanangu una kodi ngapi wewe? (My son, how many times have you defaulted on tax?). He would then sentence the young defaulters to wash his wifes underpants for three months.', 'Unaonaje ukienda kule kwa mamako ukamfulie nguo kwa muda wa kama miezi tatu hivi? (How about you going to your mothers (his wife) and washing her underclothes for about three months? Only this was not a question he was posing but a sentence he was handing down.', 'The British treated the locals as virtual slaves and any time officials such as district commissioners and district officers were going for public meetings, they would travel part of the way in motor vehicles and then be carried for several kilometres by four locals in turns in a triumphal entry into the venue. If the carriers made the mistake of dropping the official, they would be shot promptly.', 'Headmen would also be instructed to pick ten able-bodied men from each village who were forced to work at the sisal plantations for a period of nine months without pay. Others would be forced to tap rubber in Magarini for months, also without pay.', 'No bushman (African) was allowed to own beach plots and woe unto those who worked in white mens homes or hotels. In the white mans eye, the African was lower than the dog and if one was caught drinking from a cup, the cup would be broken and burnt and the offender whipped or even shot.', 'The African worker could only eat the leftovers served on a piece of paper and drink from disused metal containers.', 'The Mazrui Arabs traded in ivory but if an African was caught with elephant tusks, the askaris would kill the culprit, bury him in a shallow grave and then go sell the tusks to Somali ivory traders.', 'In the mid 1950s, as the freedom struggle gained momentum and stories of the Mau Mau exploits reached them, the Giriama people gathered the courage to threaten the British officials as they tried to cross rivers to address meetings on another ridge using bows and arrows, but this was quickly discouraged by the gun-wielding askari kanga.', 'Born in 1934, Kazungu Mudhengi worked in the hotel industry in the early days and remembers making food that he could not even taste and living in a workplace where his wife could not step into the isolated shed that was his sleeping quarter. Even the leftovers we ate, we did secretly as the Mzungu would rather feed it to the dogs. We did not even eat such fruits as the mango that was grown by our people.', 'A man he worked with was one day caught by the Memsahib drinking coffee in the hotel kitchen and to this day, Kazungu remembers the brutal beating the man received.', 'I have never seen a man so mercilessly whipped for eating food. And those who worked on sisal farms were even worse off; one worker was bitten by a snake resulting in a leg amputation and he was sent home without a single cent or medical care.', 'Katana recalls the Arab absentee landowners would wait until the coconuts planted by the African squatters were ready, then haul them to court on charges of occupying his land illegally.', '\n']"

According to Raila, whose opposition union with the likes of Kalonzo Musyoka was breaking up, this was aimed at skewing the election in favour of Kibaki.', 'On December 22, 2007, the ODM presidential candidate made another sensational claim - that the government was plotting to rig him out of the Langata seat by using Administration Police officers. Raila also warned that there would be chaos if the government attempted to rig the 2007 general election.', 'He went on to win the constituency election but lost the highly dispute Presidential poll to Kibaki and immediately all hell broke loose in Kenya as chants of No Raila, No Peace! filled the air. Over the next six months, we lost 1,500 of our citizens and 650,000 others were displaced from their homes.', 'On February 21, 2013, Raila called reporters again and claimed that senior civil servants were approaching his MPs to ditch his Cord outfit. He then claimed that the government, which he was part of as Prime Minister, was working with IEBC to rig in Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto.', 'A year earlier, Raila had referred to the Supreme Court as mahakama bandia (rogue court) after a January 13, 2012 ruling on the date of the general election. e court had ruled that the election could be held within 60 days of the expiry of Parliaments term on January 15, 2013, or in 2012 if Raila and Kibaki dissolved the coalition government in writing.', 'On March 17, 2012, the IEBC announced elections would be held on March 4, 2013 following the court ruling. Speaking in Kisii that weekend, Raila said the IEBC was interpreting a decision by mahakama bandia. e pattern is clear: Raila Amollo Odinga is a man who will attack all institutions without giving a second thought to the possible repercussions. In fact, one would wonder how the former PM expects the same institutions to respect him should he ever become President.', 'As we head to the August 8 election, sensing defeat, Raila has decided to use the tactic of attacking each and every institution in this country. He launched an attack on the judiciary when he lost the 2013 petition where he couldnt prove his allegations and continues to do so whenever the court does not rule in his favour.', 'When his Okoa Kenya initiative fell through because he and other opposition politicians could not get one million Kenyans to support their referendum drive, he launched a scathing attack on the IEBC. Today, we have new IEBC commissioners but he is still on the commissions case, with the latest sensational claim that the National Intelligence Service is using BVR kits to register foreigners. His claims are not only absurd but make one wonder why anyone would want to discredit the institutions that Kenyans look up to.', 'The NIS has never had a role in the electoral process other than briefi ng the various relevant bodies on security threats that may interfere with the polls. Claiming that NIS is registering foreigners without producing an iota of evidence is most irresponsible of the former PM. Raila must stop intimidating Kenyans and the various institutions that work for them. He must allow Kenyans to exercise their democratic right without threats to various institutions or to Kenyans.', 'As a national leader, Raila should be working on not only uniting Kenyans but also ensuring that Kenyans grow their faith and confidence in institutions. His remarks today ring similar to those that he made 10 years ago and which led to the post-election violence.', '\n']"

', 'Some see this as benefiting Africa; others as detrimental to the real needs of African countries and peoples. Some critics have used phrases like the second scramble for Africa and re-colonization of Africa to describe the new development. The debate goes on.', 'Yet, there is one subject that has not received the serious attention it urgently deserves. The subject is arms transfers and sales, both legal and illegal, to Africa by the Chinese government, military-industrial complex and seemingly independent private businesses. ', 'This is not at all the intent in this short article to ignore similar practices by many other arms manufacturers and tradersthe United States, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Israel, and othersbut to focus attention on one country for the time being and keep the narrative within a manageable scope. A larger and more comprehensive expose about all arms transfers and sales to Africa by everyone else is certainly needed urgently.', 'The first thing to know and remember is that there are no reliable and comprehensive data currently available about Chinese arms transfers and sales to Africa, nor is there any transparency about them on the part of the Chinese government, military establishment and businesses. ', 'This is primarily because of Chinas consistent denial about the nature and magnitude of such operations, and her refusal to provide the needed data despite several international agreements that make it mandatory for all countries to make the information available to the international community, represented at the highest level by the United Nations and its agencies. ', 'This is despite or because of China being a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council, along with the other major arms suppliers in this highly troubled world of ours.', 'China also does not abide by any arms embargo mandated by the UN. For example, despite UN embargos on the transfer and sale of arms to Zimbabwe and Sudan, there is ample documented evidence that China has been doing so mainly in exchange for oil and precious minerals. ', 'Among the supplied weapons and systems are small arms and light weapons, more sophisticated and lethal weapons, helicopter gunships, and military aircraft. In the case of Sudan, UN observers and investigators have found such weapons having been used in the Darfur region where the worst kind of atrocities have been committed over a long period of time.', ' In another case, a ship loaded with China made arms meant for Zimbabwe during the violent election in 2008 is reported to have landed at a port in South Africa. ', 'After the dock-workers there refused to unload the ship, it is reported to have turned around to be unloaded at an Angolan port and the arms transported over land to unknown destinations.', 'Not only in these two countries but some others as well, national leaders, powerful politicians, bureaucrats, and military officers are alleged to have exchanged unreported and unaccounted for minerals produced within their countries for Chinese arms. ', 'Who all these arms have been transferred and sold to subsequently is not fully known. According to considerable anecdotal evidence, such illegal arms have definitely fuelled highly violent rebellions and human rights abuses in several locales in Africa. Rocket-propelled grenades from China have been seen in Somalia. Chinese rifles have been discovered in the Ivory Coast.', 'According to a highly reputable think-tank, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, China is now the largest arms supplier to sub-Saharan Africa, ahead of any other country engaged in similar practices. ', 'At the Africa Aerospace and Defense exhibition held in Johannesburg, South Africa in September last year, the large Chinese pavilion was surpassed in size only by the host-country and United States, the largest manufacturer and seller of all sorts of arms around the world. The Chinese pavilion displayed all sorts of arms, from small arms to highly sophisticated weapons and systems available for sale.', 'So what can be done in such a dire situation? First and foremost, public and civil society awareness about such going-ons in Africa has to be substantially raised at all levels through print and electronic media campaigns and other means. ', 'This must be followed by substantial domestic and international support for the civil society advocacy activities as well as the activities of humanitarian and human rights agencies to persuade and cajole all African governments, parliaments, legal experts, regional organizations, such as the African Union and the African Development Bank to develop tight arms control legislations, effective monitoring and control mechanisms and active databases to ensure that not only China but all the arms suppliers to Africa comply with Africas arms control legislations, proclamations and declarations, as well as genuine and agreed to peace and security needs. Africa must also insist on full transparency from everyone engaged in the transfer and sales of all arms to the continent.', ' ', 'Arun P Elhance is a writer and social commentator based in Nairobi, Kenya.', '\n']"

After all, human knowledge is increasing. We can see this concretely in the development and declining costs of new medicines like HIV drugs, and in the creation of new seeds that allow poor farmers to be more productive. Once such tools are invented, they are never un-invented  they just improve.', 'Skeptics point out that we have a hard time delivering new tools to the people who need them. This is where innovation in the measurement of governmental and philanthropic performance is making a big difference. That process  setting clear goals, picking the right approach, and then measuring results to get feedback and refine the approach continually helps us to deliver tools and services to everybody who will benefit.', 'Innovation to reduce the delivery bottleneck is critical. Following the path of the steam engine long ago, progress is not doomed to be rare and erratic. We can, in fact, make it commonplace.', 'Though I am an optimist, I am not blind to the problems that we face, or to the challenges that we must overcome to accelerate progress in the next 15 years. The two that worry me the most are the possibility that we will be unable to raise the funds needed to pay for health and development projects, and that we will fail to align around clear goals to help the poorest.', 'The good news is that many developing countries have growing economies that allow them to devote more resources to helping their poorest people. India, for example, is becoming less dependent on aid, and eventually will not need it.', 'Some countries, like the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, and Australia, are increasing their foreign-aid budgets; others, even traditionally generous donors like Japan and the Netherlands, have reduced theirs. The direction of many countries, including the United States, France, Germany, and Canada, is unclear.', 'Still, aid is critical. It helps people in the poorest countries to meet their basic needs. It funds innovation in the creation of new tools and services, and in their delivery. Unfortunately, aid budgets are threatened by fiscal weakness in almost all of the advanced countries. Unless voters hear about the positive impact that their generosity is having, they will inevitably focus on issues closer to home.', 'A single story, true or not, about a small amount of aid being misused can often cloud the entire field. Imagine how you would feel about investing if every article you read were only about stocks that did poorly, with no reporting on the big successes.', 'Historically, aid was discussed largely in terms of the total amount of money invested. But now that we are measuring indicators like child mortality more precisely, people are able to see the impact that aid has in stark terms  that it means the difference between, say, giving people access to HIV treatment and letting them die. When framed this way, aid has a better chance of becoming a priority.', 'But will the world align around a clear set of goals in the next 15 years? The United Nations is starting to map out new goals for the years following the 2015 expiration of the current Millennium Development Goals. As with the MDGs, the next set of goals could help to align groups doing the work, remind voters what their generosity supports, and allow us to see where we are making progress in delivering solutions to the poor.', 'The MDGs success means that there is a lot of interest in expanding them to include a broader set of issues. But many of the potential new goals lack unanimous support, and adding a lot of new goals  or goals that are not easily measurable  may sap momentum.', 'The MDGs were coherent because they focused on helping the poorest people in the world. The groups that needed to work together to attain them were easy to identify, and they could be held accountable for cooperation and progress. When the UN reaches agreement on other important goals like mitigating climate change, it should consider whether a different set of actors and a separate process might be best for those efforts.', 'The progress that the world has made in helping the poorest in the last 15 years is the kind of good-news story that happens one life at a time, so it often does not have the same visibility as a big setback, such as the outbreak of a new epidemic. From time to time, we should step back and celebrate the achievements that come with having the right goals, the necessary political will, generous aid, and innovation in tools and their delivery. Doing so has certainly deepened my commitment to this work.', ' ', 'Bill Gates is Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ', '\n']"

I have considered the possible implications of this public statement, but concluded that given the history of this country, such a public disclosure is warranted, necessary, and proper. ', 'This statement does not seek to cause alarm but to strengthen the resolve of each and every Kenyan to protect our constitution, secure our transition, and affirm our future. ', 'On Monday, February 18, 2013, as I was sitting in the Judicial Service Commission interviews for the recruitment of the Deputy Chief Justice, my office received a poison- pen letter from the Mungiki Veterans Group/Kenya Sovereignty Defence Squad. ', 'The letter, which was dated Wednesday, February 13, 2013, makes all manner of threats against the Judges, ambassadors and my person. It warns against an adversarial ruling on the Presidential and Deputy Presidential candidacy of Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto. ', 'The letter extols the violent exploits of the Mungiki movement and threatens dire consequences. This letter was posted only a day before my departure to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where I had been invited by the Tanzanian Constitution Review Commission to a one-day event to share my thoughts and experiences on Kenyas constitutional experience. ', 'I was stopped at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport by an immigration officer, who insisted that I could not travel because I had not been cleared by Mr Francis Kimemia, the PS, Head of the Public Service, and Secretary to the Cabinet. ', 'I told the official that there is no constitutional, statutory, or policy basis or requirement that provided for the Chief Justice of the Republic to seek clearance to travel from the Head of Civil Service or anybody. ', 'Further, the said circular that he was invoking to make this illegal demand and decision did not  rightly so  even have the Chief Justice listed among the public officials on it.', 'It requires quite some courage, ignorance, or political patronage or a combination of all three for an immigration officer, on his own motion, to summon the confidence to stop a Chief Justice from traveling, particularly in the face of a nonexistent circular!', 'After much haggling, I did eventually travel. The Immigration Shift Supervisor kept insisting that they were awaiting instructions. ', 'However, I still find the insistence on permission from Mr Kimemia bizarre to say the least. Even more baffling was that the Chief Registrar of the Judiciary received a purported clearance to travel letter by Mr Kimemia dated February 14, stating ..it has been noted the Chief Justice is travelling to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. ', 'Upon landing in Dar es Salaam, I received a telephone call from the Director General of the National Intelligence Service, MajorGeneral Michael Gichangi, apologising for the small hiccup at the airport. ', 'I told the DG that a Chief Justice being gratuitously stopped by anybody from traveling cannot fit the definition of a small hiccup, however generous one may want to be. It has never happened on any of my numerous previous trips.', 'I have, therefore, concluded that this is deliberate harassment; and whereas I was keen to have this resolved bureaucratically, I am convinced it is political, and public accountability requires that I make it public.', 'These two incidents evidence a pattern of emerging harassment against my person, the Office of the Chief Justice, and the Judiciary -- especially since no fewer than five judges have been attacked in the recent past, with some involving gun incidence  as we head into the elections. ', 'I, therefore, wish to state as follows: ', '1. Kenyans have invested heavily in this countrys democratisation, and this investment has resulted in a new constitution. This constitution must be protected and guarded jealously. Threats and intimidation of this nature against the Chief Justice, judges, or any other Kenyan or individual must be resisted actively, and rejected resolutely. I have given most of my life to a better Kenya and if taking it is what will be required to consolidate and secure our democratic gains in this election, or even thereafter, that is a price I am not afraid to pay.', '2. I have invested heavily in the past one and a half years in creating a new Judiciary. I have repeatedly given my pledge to the country that the Judiciary will not flinch in interpreting the constitution as is required, a task we have executed very well. For the 2013 general election, we have done sufficient ground work to handle both pre and post-election matters in accordance with the law. On February 28, 2013, we shall hold a special session with all judges of the High Court to give Kenyans a final statement on our preparedness. Therefore, candidates or their supporters  real or claimed  should not panic. We shall decide all cases independently, and with scrupulous fidelity to the constitution and the law. Let no individual, group, candidate, or supporter imagine that cowardly and darkly acts such as these will cower us. We have seen and overcome worse, and we will all soldier on for this country. None will be held hostage by a cabal of retrogrades. ', '3. The Judiciary has, in a private correspondence, communicated to Mr Kimemia as to the legal position on the matter of the small hiccup to ensure it never occurs again. ', '4. I believe that Kenyan security agencies, unless they willfully neglect or refuse to, have the capacity and resources to investigate the sources and partnerships of this threatening letter. To this end, I have this morning sent the letter to the Inspector General of Police, the Director of the Criminal Investigations Department, Director of the National Intelligence Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate this matter and give the country a progress report. I am also asking the Inspector General of Police to take the necessary steps to enhance the security of judges and other judicial officers at this time. ', '5. If anybody, any candidate, any party, any agency, or any other actor thinks that it will bend the ear, mind and resolve of this Chief Justice to do anything that is unconstitutional or illegal, then they are mistaken. On any matter that will come before me or the Supreme Court, I and the Court shall operate strictly within the confines of the constitution. Intimidation and threats are uninvited guests and will not be hosted in the execution of our mandate. ', '6. The political class must choose whether, either through direct pronouncements or suggestive behaviour, they want a peaceful, democratic and fair election free from the ring of rigging and intimidation, or whether they want to put the country on a path of violence. Whatever choice the political class and leadership makes, they must remain aware that ultimately, the people of Kenya and the rule of law will triumph. The Judiciary is playing its part in protecting and upholding the constitution; let Kenyans also do their part. ', '7. I appeal to Kenyans to hold a peaceful election. It is only by so doing that we shall silence these dark forces of retrogression and also advance our constitutional and democratic promise. My fellow Kenyans, with confidence and tribute to the nation, go and vote for our Constitution. It is the only way to reject those who threaten and proclaim violence as a false choice. Dr Willy Mutunga is the Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya.', '\n']"

', 'Overall, he had a 42 per cent approval rating, with Musyoka in second position at 20 per cent and Raila Odinga in third place with 14 per cent.', 'Over the succeeding year, this picture changed gradually but very decisively, always in the same direction  Kibaki and Musyoka gradually losing support, Odinga gradually gaining.', 'In September 2007, when Steadman announced the results for its latest monthly poll, Odinga had finally taken the lead, with 47 per cent to Kibakis 38 per cent and Musyokas eight per cent.', 'Government supporters now came out to criticise the polls  something they had not done when Kibaki was leading. Even if Raila is leading, we are not worried, said roads minister Simeon Nyachae.', 'Steadman is a businessman and he is just making money.

It was a situation that would have been unimaginable less than 10 years earlier.)\\', 'The next Steadman poll, published on October 13, just after Kibakis launch of his presidential campaign, gave Odinga a 53 per cent approval rating to Kibakis 37 and Musyokas eight.

Polls by Infotrak Harris and Strategic Research confirmed Odingas widening lead.', 'Only a poll by the little-known Consumer Insight seemed out of sync with the others, giving Odinga 44 per cent to Kibakis 41.

The degree of its variation from the other polls began to raise questions.', 'The next Infotrak Harris poll a week later gave Odinga 50.2 per cent to Kibakis 31.8 per cent. But the Steadman poll conducted at the same time showed a narrowing of the gap  45 per cent for Odinga and 41 per cent for Kibaki, with Musyoka up to 11 per cent.', 'Six days later, a Consumer Insight poll gave Odinga 40.7 per cent to Kibakis 41.4.

Kenyatta is still an ICC indictee (not a suspect, but an indictee, someone against whom what judges consider credible evidence has been laid, which is much more serious).', 'Of course, it is well-known that Kenyatta is pouring billions into his campaign  the kind of billions that no other candidate can come close to matching.', 'Less well-known to most people is that a prominent Kenyan (I have withheld his name) has privately admitted being the conduit for large sums of money that were paid to pollsters in 2007 to raise Kibakis profile.', 'This year, it would appear that there is a much more complex plot afoot, and we are seeing just the tip of this particular iceberg. Let us begin with purpoted political scientist Mutahi Ngunyis so-called analysis of purported voting patterns a few weeks ago, which skewed figures massively in favour of Kenyatta and for a few days caused a sensation  as well as alarm and despondency in some quarters.', 'That was what it was supposed to do, and it was a good piece of propaganda  you have to give Ngunyi that. It fitted seamlessly with William Rutos repeated assertion after the launch of Jubilees manifesto that We have the numbers.', 'In fact, this was virtually all Ruto had to say to every newscaster who interviewed him at KICC on that day. There was nothing like, We have the policies or We have the programmes.', 'No. Just  jubilantly  We have the numbers. It sounded alarm bells. Especially because Jubilee does not have the numbers. Ngunyis purported analysis of the numbers was itself analysed at length by this newspaper in last weeks Siasa section, which asked, Was Ngunyis purported analysis just a hoax?', 'I believe it was. Ngunyis half-baked figures and selective data do not stand up to scrutiny. Most notably, he completely ignored all the regions of the country where the coming election will be won and lost.', 'For me, it continues to be astonishing that TV stations and others persist in putting Ngunyi in the spotlight as some kind of expert  when all his predictions as far as I can remember have been spectacularly wrong.', 'His services as a columnist, making very wild and garbled assertions, have also twice been discontinued at another newspaper (whether by him or by the newspaper I dont know).', 'The articles he wrote were characterised by a variety of analogies through which Ngunyi attempted to explain what he purported to present as the vice in the country  the articles themselves finally metamorphosing into incomprehensible nonsense.', 'Ngunyi in fact has a very chequered history. Just before the 2007 elections, when Ngunyi was working for President Mwai Kibaki, he was named as the author of a report entitled Anglo Leasing: Some Thoughts, a brutal document advising the president to criminalise whistleblower John Githongos release of the dossier on the huge Anglo-Leasing corruption scandal.', 'The aim was clearly to silence Githongo and to wipe details of the scam from Kenyan collective memory, as well as to ensure there was no Anglo-Leasing-related loss of votes for Kibaki.', 'Ngunyi denied being the author of the document, as reported in the Standard newspaper of January 28th 2006, but suspicions persisted.', 'The documents author had demanded shs.2.2 million for consultancy services to counter Githongos damaging information. Ngunyi had reasons for revenge on Githongo.', 'In 2001, Ngunyi was sued for allegedly embezzling more than shs.10 million shillings, awarded some time in the 1990s by the Ford Foundation to an NGO called Series on Alternative Research in East Africa Trust (Sareat), of which Ngunyi was a director.', 'Ngunyi was sued alongside Zimbabwean minister Professor Jonathan Moyo, who was working as a Ford Foundation programme officer at the time the money allegedly disappeared.', 'Moyo is also a purported political scientist  one who switched from being a sharp critic of President Robert Mugabes government to being his chief propagandist and, according to various Zimbabwean publications, was a major player in Zimbabwes crackdown on journalists, the judiciary and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change of (now prime minister) Morgan Tsvangirai.', 'There are many guns for hire in Zimbabwe. Kenya is no different. In 1998, Ngunyis NGO had engaged Githongo to edit a regional political economy magazine called East African Alternatives.', 'According to reports, the magazine folded after four issues, and its closure was as a result of audit queries made by PriceWaterhouseCooper.', 'This led to the suit against Ngunyi by the Ford Foundation. And the Foundations star witness for the prosecution was to be none other than John Githongo.', 'The case was apparently later withdrawn, after Sareat agreed to repay the funds in question  but not before Ngunyi had written to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) asking them to probe alleged forgery of documents and money laundering at the Ford Foundations East Africa and New York offices.', 'In another strange twist of events, Ngunyi also reportedly turned turtle and offered to act as a prosecution witness against Moyo. In the document Anglo Leasing: Some Thoughts, the author recommended that Githongo be repatriated from Britain, where he had sought asylum after releasing the Anglo-Leasing dossier, and that he be charged with high treason.', 'Githongo has arrogated himself a high moral ground, the document told Kibaki. He is telling the world that you are bad and he is good. You need to deflate him. You need to cast him as an over-enthusiastic officer with good intentions but completely naive.', 'But more fundamentally, you must criminalise what he is doing. The author warned that, without this kind of action, the government in the court of public opinion was guilty as charged.', 'The author continued, The President is implicated directly or otherwise as per the Githongo dossier. This is why we must interpret public anger as a indirect assault on the President, not the implicated ministers... we must not attempt to resolve this scam, not before the 2007 elections.', 'The document also advised the government to release the Goldenberg report in a mirror image tactic that would infuriate and confuse, and recommended that the government must not fire or suspend any implicated politicians.', 'They form a ring around the president, the document continued. To remove them is to expose Kibaki. They must therefore remain in place and take the blame while inside.', 'If you remove them, the public will inevitably go for the president, demanding his resignation as well. In his tyranny of numbers scenario a few weeks back, Ngunyi served up several estimates of Kenyan voter numbers, but provided no coherent logic or calculations to justify these numbers, making wild assertions arrived at by no known polling methodology.', 'And that brings us to the current opinion polls and their methodologies and curious anomalies. All the pollsters in the last poll published indicated that they did face-to-face interviews using a digital pad.', 'While a digital pad is convenient for the researcher, a process audit would find it hard to unearth instances where individual questionnaire entries had been altered.', 'A hard-copy questionnaire lends itself well to such an interrogation process. Another concern regarding face-to-face interviews is the place of interview. ', 'The pollsters claimed to have done interviews at households between February 13 and 15  Wednesday to Friday, all working days. Who would have been interviewed in these houses? Househelps?', 'Househelps have their valid opinions too, but such an information-gathering approach totally obviates the participation of those of working age,18 years and above, who happen to be the main body of voters and thus should be the target respondents for this kind of poll. ', 'Household face-to-face interviews would be appropriate for household consumer market research (Do you use Harpic? Omo?) but definitely not for this kind of political opinion polling.', 'A house-based poll also works against the main benefits of the random process. If the pollster knows your house, it means your stated political opinion can be traced back to you.', 'Since your political opinion can get you killed, evicted or isolated, imagine how a respondent in Bondo would feel about publicly professing support for Kenyatta, or one in Gatundu doing the same for Odinga.', 'A true random process leaves a respondent anonymous, while giving them an equal chance to participate. The process reportedly being used is not random.', 'More worrying is that, according to evidence leaking out of polling houses, and contrary to reports made to the public, there were actually no house-based face-to-face interviews.', 'Pollsters have instead reportedly been conducting phone interviews based on a frame of registered mobile-phone users. While this is convenient and significantly cheaper, it is scientifically lacking in the necessary discipline.', 'The sampling frame for political polling must be the national voters register. A database of mobile-phone users does not reveal such crucial demographics as the age of the respondent (to qualify them to vote), whether they are registered voters or in which voter region the phone-user resides.', 'Sample size distribution is done by regions  yet you cannot verify the regional location of a respondent in a mobile-phone interview. They could be anywhere.', 'In addition, mobile-phone accessibility in rural areas, where more than 60 per cent of registered voters reside, is unreliable at best, absent at worst.', 'And crucial is the fact that, not unlike house-based interviews, phone interviews do not support the random process. Even more worrying is the fact that any such non-random process is fraught with potential abuse.', 'Any pollster with a mind to do so can buy 1,000 mobile lines and distribute them to that number of persons, who then participate in the phone interviews.', 'There is no proof with this kind of non-random polling that this is not happening, and largely influencing responses. There are many other questions regarding sampling.', 'Opinion polling is about measuring differences, and thus analysis and presentation focus on measures of dispersion variance, range and percentile.', 'For this reason, concern is about factors that occasion difference in opinion. Such factors include age, gender, social class, education level and region.', 'The first four cannot be determined before the poll and are usually allowed to emerge naturally through the random process, but the overall required sampling frame is the national voter register, and the sample size distribution is according to the weight for each electoral area.', 'In the poll results released on February 18, pollsters Ipsos Synovate, Strategic and Infotrak claim to have employed the appropriate sampling factors, but the published results raise more questions than answers.', 'There was no firm attempt to distribute the sample on the basis of counties, the largest electoral boundary. Strategic gave a list of 32 out of the 47 counties where their research was allegedly conducted but not how the sample was distributed to those counties.', 'No intra-county sample size distribution is discussed by any of the pollsters. Nairobi, Rift Valley, Western and Central are significantly over-sampled by Strategic Africa, while Rift Valley and North Eastern are significantly under-sampled.', 'A closer look into the counties they reached reveals a significant bias towards Nyanza, Central, Western, Lower Eastern and North / Central Rift. The pollsters rationale is that they focused on the top 30 or so counties in terms of registered voters.', 'But the 32 counties sampled by Strategic Africa account for only 33.3 per cent of the registered voters. The other two pollsters samples also average less than 35 per cent.', 'The implication is that the rest of the counties that are allegedly insignificant account for nearly 65 per cent of the registered voters! The sampling distribution is clearly not representative.', 'This is of particular importance considering that this significant minority (actually, not the minority but the majority, and also the same persons who were ignored by Ngunyi in his lamentably inadequate  read deliberately abstruse and misleading  analysis) will form the deciding vote.', 'The counties sampled are traditional strongholds of the two main presidential candidates and tend to cancel each other out in terms of registered voters, thus explaining the tie purportedly captured by the pollsters.', 'Surely, any pollster worth his or her salt who professed to have polled a tie at 45 per cent  to which a candidate needs to add only six per cent to win  would consider a constituency of 65 per cent somewhat significant!', 'The numbers presented in the analysis tables thus appear to reveal a deficient weighting system.

The coming together of the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin to propel a candidate to State House is not only unprecedented but untested, and CORD is hoping against hope that Jubilees Rift Valley vote suffers a total Bradley Effect on March 4.', 'Culmination of 10-year-long Southern Strategy', 'If this happens it will have achieved the ultimate aims of the PMs Southern Strategy, launched as long ago as the 2002 presidential race when Uhuru was one of the two main candidates and actually had the Kalenjin vote bloc locked up, courtesy of the then outgoing President Daniel arap Moi.', 'That year the Southern Strategy was not deployed against the Kikuyu community as a vote bloc, both main candidates being Kikuyu, with Kibaki getting the backing of the rest of the country and Uhuru the Kalenjin and part of the southern Kikuyuland vote.', 'Wikipedia defines The Southern Strategy as in American politics referring to the Republican Party strategy of gaining political support or winning elections in the Southern section of the country by appealing to racism against African Americans.', 'Wikipedia goes on: The strategy was first adopted under future Republican President Richard Nixon and Republican Senator Barry Goldwater in the late 1960s. The strategy was successful in many regards. It contributed to the electoral realignment of Southern states to the Republican Party, but at the expense of losing more than 90 per cent of black voters to the Democratic Party.', 'For Raila Odinga, the Southern Strategy has worked well across two consecutive presidential elections in Kenya, 2002 and 2007, with the latter bringing him closer to the presidency than any losing candidate in the history of Kenyan electioneering has ever been.', 'What will it do for him in combination with the Bradley Effect and the Dog-whistle politics factor?

Why would there be sanctions?', 'In fact, not one foreign government has actually come out to threaten economic sanctions against a possible Kenyatta administration. And for very good reasons.', 'While some elements in the West may have wished to influence the Kenyan elections by issuing vague statements about only maintaining essential contact, with a future Kenyatta government, as the British have, such threats are entirely implausible.', 'Realistically, the international community cannot afford to place any kind of sanctions on Kenya. Countries such as Britain and the U.S. cannot reduce diplomatic relations with Kenya because it is the key regional partner in the Global War on Terror.', 'The fate of al-Shabaab racked Somalia and the stability of East Africa as a whole is of paramount strategic importance to the West and Kenya is in a unique position to help like no other regional government can.', 'The Kenyan government has lead the military campaign to drive al-Shabaab out of Mogadishu and as far back into Somalia as possible. It is our men who are currently fighting on the ground to secure the border and keep the Somali capital free of the Islamic militants.', 'With France battling al-Qaeda in the Maghreb and America and Britain fighting in the middle east, those countries are unprepared to commit troops on the ground in the Horn of Africa. Kenya is their best and only option in the region for military assistance.', 'The Jubilee Coalition has pledged to continue committing its troops to fight al-Shabaab in Somalia and to secure stability in the region. Therefore, in the case of Mr. Kenyatta being elected president, western governments - especially Britain and the U.S. - will not risk the future of their war on terror by destabilising their relationship with the Kenyan government.', 'In terms of economics and international trade, Britain, and its citizens, have too much invested in the Kenyan economy to impose serious sanctions and thereby damage their own economy.', 'A significant portion of the privately-held land in Kenya is still owned by British citizens who are involved in the tourism industry and produce coffee, tea and horticulture for export.', 'Kenya also remains one of the last of Britains former African colonies to still have a largely positive and close relationship with the former colonial power.', 'At a time when Kenyan trade and economic partnerships with China are growing faster than with Britain, the U.S. and Europe, the West cannot afford to lose more African ground to the East.', 'Economists and political scientists agree that sub-Saharan Africa is set to make massive economic advances in the next 20 years. Western countries will not risk the economic damage isolating Kenya by way of sanctions could cause themselves now and in the future.', 'Knowing this, a group of Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Charge daffaires from a group of countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, the U.S. and the EU wrote and signed an editorial that was printed in the Daily Nation on Wednesday.', 'In it, they stated: The choice of Kenyas leaders in the election is up to the Kenyan people alone. We do not endorse any candidate or party over another. What we do support is a free, fair, peaceful and credible election.', 'The editorial made no mention of any possible sanctions on Kenya based on which candidate is elected President and also made no mention of consequences or the possibility of having restricted contact with any Kenyan administration.', 'Finally, putting aside our relationships and strategic significance to the international community, there are three fundamental conditions for imposing sanctions that have been historically accepted and observed around the world:', '1) To force cooperation with international law in cases where a government party is not cooperating; 2) To contain a threat to peace within a geographical boundary, for instance by maintaining an illegal nuclear weapons programme; and 3) in following a UN Security Council condemnation of a specific action or policy of a member or non-member nation.', 'None of those three conditions are met in the Kenyan case. Firstly, Mr. Kenyatta is currently cooperating with international law and has pledged to continue to do so.', 'Secondly, our government has no nuclear weapons programme and has made no other threats to peace in our region. And lastly, there has been no UN Security Council condemnation of any action on the part Kenyan government, nor is there any reason to be one in the future.', 'Kenyans need to stop thinking of themselves as in any way beholden to or dependent on western governments for economic subsistence. We have grown beyond that point.', 'But it is because we continue to think of ourselves as inferior, unequal partners to the West that we let ourselves be bullied by campaigners and fearmongers into believing something as ridiculous as the possibility of Kenya facing sanctions for allowing its citizens to democratically elect our next leader.', 'This is a time when the West needs more friends in Africa, not less. Kenya has been a powerful and strategic regional ally to the international community.', 'Europe and America will not choose to damage that important relationship by imposing sanctions - no matter who Kenyans vote for on March 4th.', 'Kenyans should therefore not be intimidated as we move closer to the polls. On March 4th 2013, let us vote; but let not our voting be out of fear, but out of hope.', ' ', 'Sakaja Johnson is the National Chairman, TNA.', '\n']"

It has a negative effect. For example, if funds meant for the development of football go elsewhere then youre killing football and that is happening.', 'Similar strong sentiments were echoed by former Harambee Stars international Sammy Sholei who not only agreed with Rachier but added: Corruption is a big, big issue in football in this country.', 'He went on to astonishingly accuse the FKF of witch hunting, claiming: If you write exactly what Ive told you tomorrow, youre going to get a letter from the federation. Threats go out even to radio stations. There is one, where I used to go and air my views which also received a letter from FKF.', 'Such widespread condemnation of the FKF by prominent football figures will undoubtedly be hugely concerning for Kenyans; especially considering Kenyas current long-standing poor standards and the believed extent of changes needed to turn that around.', 'The Harambee Stars have never qualified for the World Cup and have failed to make it past round one of the African Cup of Nations. A poor youth development structure figured several times as a key factor in urgent need of transformation.', 'I have never seen any football competition that involves the small kids in this country, former Harambee Stars defender Sammy Omollo observed. And what did the FKF have to say about all this? Efforts to get hold of chairman Sam Nyamweya were unfruitful.', 'However, in an interview with FKF Technical Director Elly Mukolwe, the common theme was ironically money, or a lack of it, more precisely. When asked whether our kids lack competitive football, Mukolwes response was: In our country, the only problem we have is finances.', 'When asked why the Harambee Stars rarely play international friendlies in Kenya, the response was also monetarily driven: We dont have money.', 'If a team comes here, they want us to pay for their accommodation, they want us to pay for their allowances and they want us to pay for their air tickets.', 'Because we dont have money, there is no capacity to play against other nations (at home). We want to expose our players but we cant manage because we dont have money.', 'When asked about the alleged corruption his response was: How can you become corrupt when you dont have the money? You can only be corrupt when you have the money.', 'If one were to base a drinking game over the amount of times Mukolwe used the word money, theyd have passed out before the end of the interview.', 'As FKFs Technical Director, it should of course be Mukolwes job to oversee the technical development of Kenyan footballers. So when asked Does Kenyan football need a distinct style of play to coach players?', 'Mukolwes response was revealing: There are various countries with various types of coaching. It depends on what type of players you have. In Holland they prefer the four by four.', 'Clearly someone needed to inform him that 4-2-4 is traditionally a British system as the Dutch evolved the 4-3-3 from which the concept of Total Football emerged.', 'At least Mukolwe agreed that a complete revamp of Kenyan football was a necessity saying: Yes and this is what were trying to do now. But the hiccups are coming from a lack of finances because football needs a lot of money.', 'In Mukolwes defence, it is true that Kenyan football suffers from a lack of funding and consequently insufficient resources. Mukolwe blamed this on inadequate sponsorship which was also claimed by the others, including Omollo.', 'Theres hardly anybody pumping any money into Kenyan football. Football is largely neglected in this country and the budget for it is something that is small and embarrassing when we talk about budgets Mukolwe said.', 'However, Sholei, Rachier and Omollo all argued that it was the FKFs role to attract much-needed sponsorship and redirect it into football. This, they felt was not being done. The arguments of each and more will be presented each weekend, as we seek to unravel the worrying matter of the Harambee Stars.', '\n']"

While becoming an MP or a senator is the pinnacle of life to many a politician, the Orange Democratic Party nominated Senator from Kakamega County thinks otherwise.', 'As politicians jet set in choppers or their fuel guzzlers, announcing to all and sundry about their next big moves, Omondi is doing the opposite. She has announced her candidature for the Kholera Ward representative in Matungulu constituency.', 'Why would a senator decide to run for an MCA position? The salary of a senator is double that of an MCA. A senator has more privileges compared to a ward rep. The former has more allowances and influence than the latter, so why then, would a senator want to be a ward representative?', 'I have always yearned to work at the village level. This is where a politician who has the welfare of the people at heart, would want to be throughout the year, Omondi says.', 'Since plunging into politics 11 years ago during the Kenya Constitutional Review process that culminated into the promulgation of the countrys new constitution in 2010, the 44-year-old politician had always envisaged herself working at the grassroots level.', 'The mother of three teenagers describes the county assembly as the kitchen of the counties. Who doesnt want to be in the kitchen where the cooking is done, Omondi asks.', 'However, Omondis journey to get to the county assembly has not smooth sailing.', 'As soon as she announced her interest for the local seat, her opponents have been on her case with hammer and tongs. They have been going round the ward asking voters why they would even consider electing a half-person who cannot wear shoes.', 'The senator was nominated to represent persons with disabilities in 2013, but her tenure started off a sour note After my nomination, the seat was later given to Harold Kipchumba from Baringo County, another person living with disability. I was very upset because I felt I deserved the nomination.', 'Shortly after, when she returned from a conference in Tanzania, an agitated Omondi decided to seek justice. I didnt have money to file the case and to execute of the Sh1 m bond but fortunately, a well-wisher gave me the cash, the senator says.', 'After a six-month court battle, Omondi won the case and was sworn in to Senate on October 15, 2013.', ' I was elated. I deserved the seat because of my many years of tireless work in ODM for the people of Kholera and Kakamega county.', 'Her win was not in vain. Omondis contribution in the Senate has been above average. She has pushed for the implementation of policies and laws that affect people with various disabilities.', 'Persons living with disability have a special spot in her heart. In 2013, she went round the county campaigning for the rights of the disabled but did not relegate issues touching on women, youth and children to the periphery.', 'On February 23, 2013 she brought before the Senate a bill seeking to allow counties to have a disability regional board. This is important to me and others because the boards will ensure the needs of the disabled are effectively addressed at the local levels, she says.', ' I carry the burdens of everyone in the community. I want to do more for the people of Kakamega.', 'Since senators have no funds per se, set aside for various projects unlike MPs, senators are forced to dig deep into their pockets to help those who are in need. The senator often travels all over the country to push governors and other development partners, to come up with friendly policies for people with disabilities.', 'I use my own salary going round the country but I am not complaining as long as I touch somebodys life positively.', 'However, owing to her disability, Omondi is limited in her movements. She, for example, cannot visit far flung areas like Turkana and Northern Kenya where she would like to make the lives of the disabled more comfortable.', 'It is expensive for me to always fly because of limited resources. Also, because I am in a wheelchair, flying means that I must at least travel with two or three people to help me get around. This is also not sustainable economically in the long run, Omondi says.', 'Despite all the hurdles, her travels and efforts have borne fruits. For example, Mombasa county offers free medical treatment to the disabled and Bungoma county has a disabled fund to empower those living with disability.', 'We make laws at the Senate and allocate monies to counties for various projects but when the funds reach the counties, there are no effective ways of ensuring they are used for the purposes intended, she says as she extends her hand to greet Taita Taveta Senator Boy Juma Boy. I am interviewing her at Parliament Building.', 'The politician had a rough childhood. She had a polio attack when she was only six months old. Four months later, her father died. I thank God for my mother. She was very strong woman. Although the neighbours took jibes at her for caring for a disabled child, she did not give up on me.', 'While her mother chose to remarry later, the marriage did not last due to malicious talks from the villagers. They taunted Omondi calling her a pussycat and always telling her mother to abandon her cat.', 'My step-mother used to talk badly about my mother and I. There was no peace in the home and so my mother left the marriage to take care of me.', 'Omondi faced more uphill challenges going to school even though it was near her home. I used to crawl on all my fours to and from school because I didnt have a wheelchair, she says.', 'This all changed when one day, a well-wisher bought her one after witnessing her struggle going to school. Her fortunes changed when former area MP Dr Elon Wameyo, himself a person who lived with disability, took up the task of sponsoring her throughout high school.', ' He also found me a job which helped me finance my college education, she says. The former telephone operator is forever grateful.', 'She met her husband Alfred Omondi at a church fellowship in Kakamega in 1996. He has been her rock, loving her and supporting her throughout their marriage.', 'When he proposed, she was hesitant because she didnt believe he genuinely wanted to marry a disabled woman and yet there were many beautiful able-bodied women other there.', 'When Alfred and his siblings met my mother to ask my hand in marriage, I started to view him differently. I believed he loved me and wanted us to spend our lives together.

The TV stations are unlikely to be getting into this business as missionaries; that is unlikely to be their newfound contribution to philanthropy at election time. ', 'Politicians know that election time is when there is a high premium to adverstise and the media falls into good times in such moments. Bring popular politicians on the screen for a verbal duel and all their supporters and detractors will no doubt be glued. Advertisers will no doubt scramble for space, definitely at a premium price. Now, begin following my trend of thought if you are still wondering where I am going.', 'Second, which politician will, therefore, like to be used opportunistically as Raphael Tuju put it? To begin with, a participant in the debate such as President Uhuru and Raila would need full disclosure about DBL: Its directors, the purpose for which the firm was set up and whether any other political entity  locally or abroad  has some interest or influence on it. These are pertinent issues that cannot be swept under the rug. DBL should be aware that sections of the public are asking these questions. Kenyans have become much more aware of their need to know than ever before.', 'Third, both Raila and Uhuru are themselves walking television stations. In other words, wherever they are, the media will run after them looking for news. They sell. But they have never asked any media owner to pay them royalties although they make money for them. They get something in return which is difficult to quantify  publicity. Ask yourself now, why would Raila and Uhuru risk getting some publicity whose content they are not sure of, when they know fully well that just by staying away from the debate that will itself be news? I may sound like a cynic but the question is worth asking. Swallow that and I will tell you another.', 'Fourth, I have talked about content, let me elaborate. In the US, where such debates have become an accepted tradition, there are some procedures that are always followed, and which are well known to both the candidates and the debate organisers. In fact, these procedures were worked on quite some time ago to the extent that they have become part of the political culture in that country. In our case, these procedures still exist in the heads, or perhaps the files, of institutions such as DBL. Advertising these procedures in the newspapers and assuming that presidential candidates will read and agree with them automatically is perhaps presumptive at best and naive at worst. ', 'My advice would run something like this. Put in the newspapers an announcement that you would like to have an open forum on presidential debates to which all political parties are invited. Simultaneously to that announcement, write a much more detailed letter to all those who have announced intentions to be president to come and participate in the forum, or send their representatives. This should have been done early last year. It would have set the ball rolling on this discourse that would have made most candidates have a  buy in much earlier rather than be confronted with a fait acompli katika kipindi cha lala salama as we witnessed early last week.', 'Fifth, make sure that such open fora gradually and systematically develop the content and format of such debates. Dont make the content and format be a sole product of an institution such as DBL. You are not manufacturing a detergent, where the scientist is the only person who knows the formula. You are dealing with a very versatile, fluid, sensitive and at times slippery social phenomenon called politics. Even the best political players dont know where its boundaries begin or end: They are constantly seeking to keep it in control, manipulate and shape it to their advantage. Why do you think that you can thrash out matters outstanding in organising a debate in less than two weeks when those matters have only been isolated by you and not the key players?', 'Sixth, take note that the key players are not always the key players. While it may be easy to identify the major candidates as the key players, you cannot always rule out the minor candidates as not being the key players (please note my quotes). DBL decided on a solution that was itself part of the problem. This problem could have been sorted out much more systemically had the right procedure been adopted in the first place. But it wasnt.', 'Seventh, please ask yourself the question, how useful are the presidential debates in the Kenyan context?', 'My honest opinion is that they are useful in so far as they provide the voters with an opportunity to see and hear their leaders discussing pertinent issues that a presidential election should deal with. ', 'Further, they should also give journalists as well as the people the opportunity to ask the candidates questions about why they want to be president, and what they are likely to do when they get to power. Now, in the event that the candidates turn down the idea of taking part in a joint live TV debate for whatever reason, we should not cry over spilt milk: All is not lost though heaven appears to be lost. We can do the second-best thing: Invite each candidate to face a panel of questioners to ask him or her about the manifesto, plans for transforming Kenya for the better, how to deal with certain thorny issues as president and so on. The people will have the opportunity to put every candidate under the political microscope and judge for themselves. Due to time, space and viewership I would suggest we give this opportunity to the two leading candidates  Raila and Uhuru.', 'The Kenya Association of Manufacturers two weeks ago on Friday organised a debate between me and Governor Jack Ranguma at Acacia Hotel in Kisumu. The interview was shown widely on a few TV networks and solicited tremendous interest in the county. For those of you who may not be aware, Ranguma and I are standing for Kisumu governor Kisumu in this election. An initiative by NTV to have a rematch last Saturday did not work out because the governor had apparently travelled to Uganda.', 'Maybe the county government of Kisumu should, through a Bill in the County Assembly, pass an enabling legislation encouraging such debates. Such legislation should not be laced by the spice of seeking to control free speech and debate but should encourage a culture of dialogue and political hygiene in public discourse, especially during election time.', '\n']"

In contrast to this, numerous opinion polls have consistently placed the CORD Coalition ahead of Jubilee with the most recent poll saying that the election is now a virtual tie. The polls say, in effect, that no party can win this election in the first round. Who is right? The polls, without question. Though Mutahis argument has gained traction in certain circles, it is wrong-headed and the numbers on which it rests have been tortured to yield results they cannot sustain. This article explains the basic errors and spurious conclusions on which the Tyranny of Numbers stands. Put simply, the analysis is so flawed Mutahi should refund the money of the client that paid for it.', 'The Tyranny of Numbers makes a plausible but trivial claim, that is, that Kenyas voting is historically influenced by ethnicity. This claim is plausible because identity is central to our national life- as it is in Belgium, Lebanon and any other multicultural country you may care to name.  It is trivial because no one has ever won an election in Kenya through exclusive ethnic votes without mobilizing at least three ethnic groups and so undercutting the argument that people vote ethnicity. ', 'On the basis of that claim, Ngunyi then uses electoral demographics to build what, on examination, is a house of cards. The Jubilee Alliance, he says, begins with such a large numerical advantage the effort needed to secure an electoral victory is infinitesimally small. Barring a major catastrophe- including an assassination- Jubilee should win the presidential election in the first round. This inevitable victory comes from the Jubilee Coalitions bankable ethnic vote of 6.2 Million (or 43.2% of the total vote). This number is basically a totting up of the registered GEMA and the Kalenjin voters. On that same ethnic logic, Mutahi reckons that CORD Coalition starts off with 19.2% of the vote or 2.74 million votes. For CORD to win, he says, they need to double their support. Or as he puts it, for CORD to catch up with Jubilee, it must multiply each of its Kamba and Luo vote by 2.3. Virtually impossible is the implication. Well? This is numerology not numeracy. Here is why.', 'The Tyranny of Numbers is built on five easily exposed errors and fallacies. ', 'First, to say that Kenyans vote along ethnic lines does not lead to the conclusion that they vote for only their tribesman. Kenyans may mobilize along ethnic lines, a fact probably driven by weak political parties, but ethnic votes can and have historically split or moved tactically to politicians from other ethnic groups. In fact the only vote that has historically not moved is the Kikuyu vote. Mutahi analysis assumes that what is true of the Kikuyu is true of all ethnic groups in Kenya.', 'Secondly, even though the ethnic numbers seem plausible on the face of it scientific surveys, such as opinion polls, have consistently shown that Kenyans wont always vote the way Mutahi predicts. And that in fact, the CORD Coalition has a much larger base  nearly double- the Kamba/Luo ethnic core Mutahis calls their bankable vote. Contrary to everything Mutahi says, the opinion polls suggest, as they did in 2007, a rather close election that will most probably be decided in a run-off. In fact the polls suggest that the so-called Jubilee """""" head-start does not exist. By nomination day, CORD had already made up ground on Jubilee by increasing its core support way beyond its ethnic base of Luo and Kamba whereas the Jubilee leaders had not. In effect, CORD has no catching up to do.', 'Thirdly, Mutahi misses the effect of incumbency on elections. In 1992 and 1997 and 2007, the leading candidates for president, Daniel arap Moi and Mwai Kibaki, ran as incumbents. So is Raila in 2013. ', 'Fourthly, there are almost 3.5 million newly registered voters who nobody knows as yet how they will vote.  It is not possible to project historical voting patterns on this group. ', 'Finally, Ngunyis voter-turnout figures for the GEMA block are not plausible. The turnout blind spot leads him to grossly overstate the overall GEMA numbers.', 'FIVE RESPONSES TO THE TYRANNY OF NUMBERS', 'These five errors and fallacies mean that Mutahis conclusions are not just implausible, they are plainly mistaken and probably propagandist. We consider each of them in turn and provide evidence that refutes every one of Mutahi Ngunyis claims.', 'Proposition 1: ', 'Ethnic groups do not always vote for their own (Even when there is a viable ethnic candidate)', 'Leaving the fact of incumbency, which is discussed below, past presidential elections show that any candidate who relies on a narrow ethnic base, two communities, for instance, is unlikely to win no matter how substantial their ethnic base. More critically, except for the Kikuyu, an analysis of the elections that have taken place in Kenya since 1992 shows that all other communities have done one or both of the following: split their votes between different candidates from other ethnic groups or voted as a group for a candidate from another ethnic group. This is tactical voting not ethnic voting. It is based not on loyalty but on calculation.', 'Let us look at the election results since 1992 to see whether this conclusion holds up.

But the two candidates did not do as well outside of Nairobi and Eastern Provinces, both of them GEMA strong-holds. Matiba made 25% in Nairobi, Central and Western, but he also made 25% in Western Province because Martin Shikuku partnered with him. Kibaki made 25% in Central and Eastern. But Eastern, mainly Ukambani, gave Moi 36.8%. ', 'When we drill down, some interesting things come up. Even though the Luhyas may have mobilized as a community, they nevertheless split their vote, giving some to President Moi and some to Matiba. This probably reflects internal communal disagreements about who would be best placed to protect their interests between Moi and Matiba, exactly the kind of argument we would expect to hear in tactical voting. It may be argued in rebuttal that the Luhyas would have been no different from the Kikuyus if they had a presidential candidate from their own community.

Though the Luhya community had a presidential candidate, Kijana Wamalwa, they split their vote between Wamalwa and President Moi, clearly a case of tactical voting. That fact also underlines the fallacy of the Tyranny of Numbers assumption that in 2013 the Luhya vote is Musalia Mudavadis.  President Moi also won in Eastern Province, where it had been assumed, on ethnic voting projections, that the Meru vote would go to Mwai Kibaki, the GEMA candidate, and the Kamba vote to the Kamba presidential candidate, Charity Kaluki Ngilu. ', 'Indeed, based on exactly the assumptions that Mutahi makes in his analysis, the opposition failed to agree on one candidate to contest against President Moi on the logic that they could force a run-off by using their regional ethnic votes to stop Moi from satisfying the 25% in five provinces rule. But this logic collapsed with Moi comfortably winning more than 25% in Western and Eastern Provinces. ', 'Once again, the only community that voted almost exclusively for their own candidate was the Kikuyu. Kibaki got 89.4% of the vote in Central. It is clear that the Luos also voted by a very large majority for their own, Raila Odinga. But the fact that both Kibaki and Moi- who are neither Luo nor Kisii, the two communities resident in Nyanza - got as many votes as they did suggests more diversified voting choices among the Luo and Kisii than among the Kikuyu. ', 'However, and as the results of the 2002 election show, the Luo vote can move to a non-Luo candidate even in an election in which there is a credible Luo candidate. In 2002 they would ignore James Orengo, one of the leading lights of the pro-democracy, to move with Raila Odinga to support Mwai Kibaki. This is another example of tactical voting and not merely emotional ethnic voting. The 2002 election shows that the opposition leaders had recognized and their supporters had accepted that splitting the vote would hand an electoral victory to President Mois candidate, Uhuru Kenyatta. ', 'To round off the analysis of 1997 results, let us look at the outcome in the Coast Province. In this multi-ethnic province, nearly 2/3 (63.4%) of the vote went to President Daniel arap Moi, a Tugen. This means that the Coast Province actually voted as if they were one ethnic group even though it is one of Kenyas most ethnically diverse regions.

This means that the Kikuyu question was irrelevant: the election would have to be won outside Central Province. Indeed, all previous elections have actually been won outside Central Province. The results suggest that there is no two-tribe alliance between the Kikuyu and one other large tribe that could win an election in the first round, whether under the old constitution- a majority of the popular vote plus 25% of the votes in five provinces or even under the new Constitutions requirement of an absolute majority plus 25% in 24 counties. ', 'In all past elections, Kikuyu candidates  not supported by at least two or three non-GEMA leaders- have not generally done well outside of the core GEMA electoral areas. Of course this could also be said to be true of other candidates, except that no other ethnic based candidate begins with the same numerical advantage as a Kikuyu-GEMA candidate does. In other words, there is no basis for Mutahis assumption that because Uhurus core block has so many votes it necessarily follows that there will he will be able to easily mobilize the additional support he needs from other parts of Kenya to win the election in the first round. ', 'Some background will help fix this point. In 1992 the two Kikuyu candidates, Matiba and Kibaki only managed to get 25% or more in two and three provinces respecitively: Kibaki in Central and Eastern and Matiba in Central, Nairobi and Western (because of the Shikuku factor). Under the old Constitution, a combined platform would have had more votes than Moi but that does not mean that it would have won the election in the first round. It may be argued that the combined Matiba and Kibaki vote in the Rift Valley would have made the 25% required in that province. But, given that Kibaki failed to make the 25% vote in the Rift Valley in 1997 when he was the only GEMA candidate, it is possible that some of the votes that Matiba got in the Rift Valley in 1992 were not transferable to Kibaki and vice versa. In other words, there is nothing to suggest that if Kibaki and Matiba had joined forces they would have won the election in the first round without one more ethnic block.', 'In fact in 1997 when Kibaki was the only serious GEMA candidate he got 31% of the total vote but managed to make 25% in only 3 provinces:  Central, Eastern and Nairobi, core GEMA areas. It is only in 2002, with the support of Raila, Mudavadi and Kalonzo that he got more than 25% in all eight provinces. ', 'No GEMA Candidate has ever made more than 25% outside of GEMA strong-holds without substantial support of at least two regional heavy-weights. In fact, in 1992 Kibaki got less than 10% in all non-GEMA provinces. In contrast, Oginga Odinga who started out with a core vote of less than half of Kibakis core vote (if we believe Mutahi) scored more than 15% in three non-Luo provinces: Nairobi (20.2%); Western (17.9%) and Coast (16.1%). Though Matiba scored 18.7% in the Rift Valley, a reflection of the Kikuyu diaspora vote, he scored less than 11% in all other non-GEMA areas except Western. ', 'Uhuru is the only Kikuyu candidate who has ever done well outside of GEMA core areas- in 2002 - but then he was not seen as a GEMA candidate in that election. This fact was clearly manifest in the fact that he performed very poorly in all GEMA areas: he trailed Kibaki by a ratio of 3:1 in Nairobi and Eastern provinces and by a ratio of 2:1 in Central Province. ', 'But, if GEMA candidates do not perform well outside of GEMA cores areas, how does one explain Uhurus seemingly strong performance in precisely those areas in 2002? Unfortunately, that good performance outside of the GEMA core does not look as impressive analysed closely. ', 'Consider: in percentage terms, Uhuru got 10.4% fewer votes than Moi had in 1997 (see Table 4 below). What the data shows is that even with President Mois support, Uhuru lost very substantial grounds in all non-GEMA core areas that Moi had won in 1997. This means that his relatively modest 10.4% overall loss is thanks to the high population numbers in Central Province. His only gain outside of core GEMA areas was in North-Eastern, a region that had never voted against incumbency since the advent of multi-party democracy. The inability of Moi to transfer his 1997 vote- especially in the Coast, Eastern, Rift Valley and Western- confirms the general poor performance of GEMA candidates outside of their core areas. The question then is: 11 years on, how will Uhuru perform outside of core GEMA areas seeing what ground he lost even with Mois support in 2002? Is the Kalenjin gain from his Ruto partnership the only gain he is likely to make?', 'Table 4: How Uhuru Lost the Moi Vote', 'Province', 'Uhurus % age  vote in 2002 by Province', 'Mois %age vote in 1997 by Province', 'Change between 1997-2002', 'Central', '30.2%', '5.6%', '+24.6%', 'Coast', '33.4%', '69.5%', '-36.1%', 'Eastern', '26.1%', '44.9%', '-18%', 'Nairobi', '20.8%', '23.6%', '-2.8%', 'North Eastern', '67.1%', '35.6%', '+31.5%', 'Nyanza', '7.6%', '20.6%', '-13%', 'Rift Valley', '53.3%', '63.4%', '-10.1%', 'Western', '21.5%', '73.2%', '-51.7%', 'Total', '30.2%', '40.6%', '-10.4%', 'Source: Constructed from defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya, ECK, results', 'The Candidate Counts: Support for Moi in 1997 vs. Support for Uhuru in 2002', 'These numbers are not encouraging for GEMA candidates. It could be argued that the 2002 election changed the dynamics. That what was true before then is no longer so. It may be said that both the 2002 and the 2007 show the potential of GEMA candidates to do well outside their own core regions. This would be a plausible basis for Mutahis argument that with Uhuru and Ruto starting off with such a large base, getting the additional one million or so votes needed to beat CORD in the first round is a no-brainer.', 'However, before making that conclusion it is important to realize what happened in 2002. To begin with, contrary to received wisdom, there was no pro-opposition wave in 2002, if a wave is understood as an efflorescence of new support. The most instructive thing about the 2002 presidential result is how closely it tracks the 1997 presidential results. In 1997 Kibaki had 31% of the vote. Raila, Wamalwa and Ngilu had a combined total of 28%. In other words, the combined Kibaki, Raila, Wamalwa and Ngilu vote in 1997 was 58%. Compare that to Kibakis results in the 2002 election. The total vote for Kibaki in 2002- garnered with the support of Raila, Ngilu and Wamalwa - was 61.3%. In other words, the total Kibaki vote for 2002 in percentage is only 3.3% more than the combined total percentage of his votes in 1997 and those of Raila, Wamalwa and Ngilu. It is the combining of the 1997 opposition result, not the explosion of a new pro-opposition wave that explains what happened in 2002.', 'What do these numbers tell us? They tell us, even if somewhat tentatively, that in a three or four horse race GEMA candidates have tended to have very concentrated regional support from their core areas and not much support outside those areas. There is therefore no basis for assuming that once a GEMA candidate locks in the GEMA/Kalenjin vote of 6.2 (as calculated by Mutahi) then the rest of the 5.1 million votes (removing the 2.7 that he has allotted to CORD) will necessarily be a walk-over for Uhuru/Ruto. ', 'Let us now consider the 2007 election. That election tells us two additional things which are relevant to how we analyze the way things will pan out in this election. ', 'First, the fact is that there is now an in-built tendency in our electoral system- with the new electoral thresholds - to move Kenyan politics towards a two party system. In such a system, swing votes such as the Kambas would have been in 2007 and Luhyas will be in 2013 are critical.', 'Second, that election also tells us that starting from a high support base  as Mutahi claims that Uhuru and Ruto have- does not translate automatically into a huge electoral advantage over those who start from a low support base- as he says that Raila and Kalonzo have. ', 'The 2002 election showed that it was the fragmentation of effort that had cost the opposition the previous two elections, not their poor performance or Kanus good performance. All sides recognized that again in 2007 and that race became, in effect, a two horse race with the Kamba as a potential swing constituency which neither Kibaki nor Raila could take advantage of to decisively win the election. The 2013 election is also a two-horse race with the Luhya this time as the swing constituency. ', 'A little probing of the 2007 numbers is revealing. If we assume that throughout 2002 to 2007, Kibaki had not lost the 31% electoral base that he brought into NARC in 2002, then if the opinion poll figures for October 2006, which gave him a 41% support base are correct, incumbency had given Kibaki only a 10% gain. Over the next 14 months - from October 2006 to December 2007 - Kibaki would increase his support by a marginal 2%. Is this yet another case of the inelasticity of the GEMA candidates votes outside of their base?  ', 'That question brings us back to the second thing we learnt from the 2007 election: high starting thresholds guarantee nothing in electoral terms: the polls gave Kibaki a support base of 41% in October 2006. This was a seemingly insurmountable 28% lead over the 13% support base that the polls gave to Raila. Yet in 14 months Raila Odinga had raised that support to 45% according to the December 18, 2007 polls (see the trend in polls from October 2006 to December 18th 2007).', 'The conclusion to draw is, once again, the opposite of the one Mutahi has drawn from his fancy math: the numbers one starts with do not make it easier to mobilize the additional votes required to win an election. If they did, the 2007 election should have been a landslide for Kibaki given where he had started in October 2006.', 'Table 5: The 2007 Presidential Election by Province', 'Province', 'Kibaki %', 'Odinga %', 'Kalonzo %', 'Registered Voters', 'Turnout', 'Nairobi', '47.7%', '44.0%', '8.1%', '1,275,021', '51.5%', 'Coast', '33.1%', '59.4%', '6.5%', '1,045,629', '57.0%', 'North Eastern', '50.3%', '47.2%', '2.3%', '315,664', '61.3%', 'Eastern', '50.4%', '5.0%', '43.8%', '2,516,998', '65.9%', 'Central', '97.0%', '1.9%', '0.7%', '2,186,315', '82.1%', 'Rift Valley', '33.5%', '64.6%', '1.4%', '3,358,285', '72.8%', 'Western', '32.2%', '65.9%', '0.7%', '1,564,854', '62.0%', 'Nyanza', '16.9%', '82.4%', '0.3%', '2,041,686', '76.2%', 'Totals', '46.4%', '44.1%', '8.9%', '14,304,452', '69.0%', 'Source: Constructed from defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya, ECK, results', 'Past elections then give us two conclusions that should unsettle Mutahis smug conclusions.', 'First, all ethnic votes are movable to non-ethnic leaders. The only vote that so far has refused to move, even if partially, to non-ethnic candidates in all four multiparty elections is the Kikuyu vote. So the assumption of an effectively bound ethnic vote for each of the leading candidates is false, a fact clearly underlined by the fact that in the polls CORD is actually leading Musalia Mudavadi in Western Province.', 'Secondly, the fact that Uhuru and Ruto appear to start off with a large so called bankable vote does not make it any easier for them to mobilize the additional small vote they need to win the election in the first round. If this were a logical necessity, then Kibaki who started off with 41% support in October 2006 polls should have had an easy time mobilizing the 9% or so additional support he needed to guarantee himself 50% of the national vote in 2007. Instead, we had a situation where Raila, starting off with 13% of the vote in 2006, increased his support by 32% in 14 months to catch up with and surpass Kibaki in the polls and force Kenyas closest election. ', 'More subtly, in spite of their high starting numbers, GEMA candidates running outside a three or four way alliance have not, historically, done well outside their core areas. Does Mutahi sense this and is he trying to wrong-foot debate about what could happen in the election and the widely predicted run-off by planting red herrings all over cyber-space?', 'The core of the Tyranny of Numbers is thus easily shown to be a spurious massaging of the numbers. But there are other equally strong objections to Mutahis numbers. Let us now turn to the opinion polls.', 'Proposition 2:', 'Opinion poll numbers are bankable; Mutahis numbers are not. ', 'Since Opinion polling was first introduced in Kenya in 1992, polls have generally called elections right. The early polls in the early 1990s, as with all new things, were bedeviled by methodological challenges, political manipulation and a general culture of distrust based on misunderstanding how sampling and surveys work. But since 2002 opinion polls have generally been within the eventual results.  As a review of opinion polls in 2010 concluded the 2002 pre-election and exit polls reasonably and accurately predicted the outcome of the general election. The 2002 polls predicted victory for Kibaki with a 62% vote, gauged Uhurus support at 31% and Simeon Nyachaes at 5%.', 'If the polls are generally on the money, how can they help us see how the 2013 election will turnout? To answer that question and to see why the Tyranny of Numbers assumptions are spurious, it would help to review the polls conducted from October 2006 to the election in 2007. Those polls are important for two reasons: First, they show us, as already noted in the preceding section, that the support that one begins with (the GEMA/Kalenjin numbers, for instance) have no relationship with where one ends up. Secondly, they also show that polls are able to capture the evolution in the political landscape quite accurately.

Kibakis had declined to 44% and Kalonzos had fallen further to 12%. This is significant because it suggests that Raila had nearly doubled his support by eating into both Kibakis and Kalonzos support bases. More significant, he had done so before joining up with Musalia, (average 6% for the period) and Ruto (averaging about 4% for the period) in the Pentagon. Since the Luo vote is only 12% of the total vote in Kenya the doubling of Railas support means that he had an additional 14% support beyond the Luo ethnic core which Mutahi Ngunyi says is the primary determinant of voting in Kenya.', 'In the nine polls reviewed here, mainly by Steadman International (now IPSOs Synovate), and one by Gallup and Consumer Insight) conducted from September to December, 2007 during which time the Pentagon was in full flow, Raila led Kibaki in all but one poll, the Consumer Insight poll of November 21st 2007.

Though that support base shrunk to an average of 34% in the five polls conducted in 2011, that number was still 22% above the Luo support base that Mutahi calls Railas bankable vote.

', 'Depending on how it could affect various spheres of governance, many people, individuals and organizations, have expressed their views over the ICC issue. The National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) recently issued a statement saying that as much as they recognize the democratic right of the people to elect whoever they like, it would be impractical for the ICC suspects to govern the country from The Hague.', 'It should be noted that NCCK was one of the institutions at the forefront of calling upon the ICC to take up the Kenyan case they led a campaign to collect one million signatures in support of the ICC process and even led a delegation to The Hague to persuade the president of the Court to take up the Kenyan case. ', 'But the Muslim community, as a stakeholder in how the country is governed, is yet to say something about the ICC factor in the forthcoming polls. Although some Muslim lobby groups have openly declared their support for various political alliances ahead of the March 4 polls, there is need for the Muslim community to look at the ICC factor from a neutral position and make an honest judgement about the choices the country makes at this crucial moment in Kenyas political history.', 'First and foremost, it is important for Muslims to acknowledge that they have a huge interest in the stability of the government after the March 4 elections. During the post-election violence of early 2008 when most parts of the country were turmoil, it was interesting to note that the Muslim-dominated parts of North Eastern province remained peaceful and, in fact, many people from troubled areas sought refuge in North Eastern.', 'A case is told of how a man from Central Province who had to flee inter-ethnic violence in Kericho had to disguise himself as a Muslim woman by dressing up in a bui bui and hijab in order to get safe passage through illegal road blocks mounted by marauding gangs out to flush out perceived rivals from enemy tribes. This means that during the post-election violence, Muslims did not have the ethnic tag and therefore above reproach. ', 'But after peace returned in the troubled areas after the post-election violence, tables turned and the Muslim-dominated areas of North Eastern and Coast region became the theatre of violence and conflict mainly due to the threat of global terrorism that was heightened by the deployment of Kenyan troops to Somalia. As a result, Muslim-dominated areas are today the ones facing the most serious security challenges.', 'Although the security challenges facing Muslim-dominated areas like North Eastern and Coast are largely blamed on extremist religious and cultural elements, the police also share in the blame for their poor organizational capacity. For example, most of the victims in the Tana Delta violence go by the names Mohammed, Hassan, Halima, Zainab, etcmeaning that they are Muslim. But the Tana Delta conflict has had nothing to do with terrorism. It has to do with politics of resource sharing and the government has not done what it should do to address the root cause of the conflict.', 'In this respect, Muslims, more than any other minority community, have a huge interest in who becomes the next president after the March 4 elections. They need a government that will honestly and firmly deal with the huge problems facing the community. But such a government can only obtain if the people elected to run it have both hands on the deck and are available fulltime to address the peoples problems this is why it would be foolhardy for Muslims to expect people indicted by the ICC to effectively deal with their problems while away in The Hague seeking to defend themselves.', 'Then there is the issue concerning the possibility of sanctions being slapped on Kenya if ICC suspects are elected. Like NCCK, Muslims must acknowledge that it would be a dangerous gamble to elect people whom the international community is likely to blacklist. Today, Kenya hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world. Majority of these refugees are Muslim brothers and sisters from troubled Somalia, and their stay in Kenya has been made possible by international humanitarian organizations.', 'In this regard, if the international community gives Kenya a cold shoulder and ends up withdrawing or scaling down its humanitarian support for refuges because the people elected to lead the government are pariahs, will Muslims step in to fully cater for the needs of their refugee brothers and sisters who, in fact, live in the Muslim-dominated regions of North Eastern province? ', 'If Muslims are honest with themselves and their Creator, then they should broadly and sincerely look at the ramifications of the ICC factor in the March 4 elections and make an intelligent choice. Apart from the ICC factor, there is the land question, which Muslims should consider when choosing their leaders in the forthcoming polls.', 'The land question has genuinely become an important policy issue ahead of the March polls. Like many other Kenyans, a huge number of Muslims live in slums commonly known as Majengo. In fact, every informal settlement in this country that goes by the name Majengo is famous for hosting Muslim populations.', 'But the reason Muslims live in Majengos is not because it is their culture its because of the discriminatory land policies that have existed since colonial times and which were perpetuated by successive governments since independence. In this regard, Muslims have suffered in silence living in Majengos because nobody was willing to change the bad land policies that ensured they dont get legal ownership of the land they live on in these urban slums. ', 'But when the new constitution was brought to a referendum in 2010, Muslims voted overwhelmingly for it because it guarantees every Kenyan equal and fair access to land resources. The huge Muslim populations that live in the Majengos of this country supported the new constitution because they saw a great opportunity to change their pathetic situation as dwellers of urban slums.', 'Hence, if Muslims still have faith in the new constitution, they should honestly elect leaders who will faithfully implement the land reforms contained in the constitution.

They were supposed to be the referee in the game but they were appointed by one of the players in the field and, therefore, they were partisan and they are the ones who were really responsible for the mess that cost this country dearly.', 'Now, since that time, a lot of water has gone under the bridge. We now have a new constitution. Secondly, we now have new electoral laws and an electoral commission.', 'What we will do as the Cord coalition is to sincerely and faithfully implement this new constitution; to ensure that the playing field is level for everybody.', 'Prime Minister, lm still interested in the composition of your government. In the technocrats who will be part of your grouping. I am interested in the people that you might name as ambassadors to represent us abroad. I am saying it could be a case of favours returned.', 'Not this time round because things have changed. First the team being the executive, that is for example the cabinet, the permanent secretaries and the diplomats have all got to be vetted by parliament which does the due diligence and then sends the names back to the president for appointment.', 'So, we will no longer have the abuse of rewarding cronies and friends. Secondly, we want to establish a system that works efficiently. So, the recruitment is going to be done on merit.', 'It will also ensure that there is equity in terms of regional balancing, so that we do not reward other people, here and there. You mentioned my relatives earlier.', 'Let me just tell you that I have never at any time been involved in the appointment of my relatives for any position. My relatives are Kenyans. When they apply, they are vetted just like any other Kenyan.', 'I think that at this point we should give you some time, Prime Minister, as we have done with others, to elaborate on the Cord coalitions commitment to an equitable distribution of the countrys wealth. Is this just a high sounding phrase? Break it down into component parts.', 'Well, first of all, the constitution has provided for devolution and, in that, there is also a formula for wealth sharing. For example, in terms of the mineral resources of this country, if they are found in a particular county, what proportion will go to that county, what proportion will go to the investor and what proportion to the national government.', 'Thats why we are saying we are going to faithfully implement the constitution to ensure that there is fairness in this country. And there are other counties which are more endowed with resources than others.', 'And there is also a provision for a balancing. Thats why, for example, we are talking of equalisation of funds, so as to be able to bridge the gap that will exist between the counties, in terms of resources.', ""We as a national government will be like the referee in this process because we don't want 47 countries under one roof; we want to have one country."", 'We want to ensure that there is uniform development across the country. So, we will create structures and systems that will enable us to monitor and supervise development throughout this country, and in doing this we will be able to change and transform this country.', 'I have, for example, in mind what happened in Malaysia. Malaysia is a multi-ethnic society, and in Malaysia they have a formula for sharing the resources of that country along ethnic lines.', 'For example there are the Malays, the Chinese, the Indians and several other minorities. They know that if you are going to recruit 100 policemen, so many must be Malays, so many will be Chinese and Indians and so on.', 'So, in other words, if you are looking for merit and its a Chinese quota, it must be a merit within the Chinese because they might also have somebody.', ""Prime Minister you have this history of having fought for liberation, having been incarcerated for your beliefs, having been tortured. You were born in 1945. Is your understanding that this time it is do or die: If Raila doesn't make it this time it will never happen. Are these things that exercise your mind as you go into the elections? Must you go down in the history books as the liberation fighter who eventually became president? Is that how you see it?"", 'No, Sibi. It is not a zero-sum game for me. For me it is a calling: I represent a group of people. I represent a system or a movement. This movement has been in existence since independence. ', 'Remember that, after independence, there was a split between two opposing forces: The forces for retention of the status quo, those who wanted to inherit the privileged position enjoyed by the outgoing colonialists.', 'And they used it to lord it over their fellow Africans. And the forces who wanted to open up the society, and provide for popular participation by the people and their governance.', 'So there are forces that have been engaged in a struggle over this last 50 years. They have been pulling in two opposite directions: The forces for change and the forces for retention of the status quo. I represent the former.', 'For people who want to change this country and allow our people to participate fully in its development. To empower the people to popular participation.', 'If the people of this country elect me for the first time, the others will have eventually triumphed. In other words, we have been governed by the forces who wanted to retain the status quo.', ""Thats the reason why Kenya's potential has not been fully realised. Because there has been very ethnicised development. And thats why the countries which were at the same level of development with Kenya, and I keep on giving the example of Korea, have left us behind with such a huge gap."", ""Korea's GDP per capita income was at $79 in 1970 against 110 for Kenya. Today, the per capita income of Korea is $22,000 against Kenyas $460."", 'That gap is because of the way Kenya has managed its affairs. We can close that gap and I want to be an agent who will help our people to close it.', '\n']"

A few weeks ago, he repeated more or less the same words to KTN presenter Joe Ageyo:', 'Even now my friend Issack Hassan will be brought results. I can see him saying he will not announce the results if they are rigged, how do you know they were rigged? I do not know if anything went wrong; that is why the law is there so that if something goes wrong you people go to court. And if the courts were not reliable, is it Kivuitus mistake? All these years we knew the courts were not reliable.', 'He told Ageyo that if he met anyone who still hates him for the 2007 mess, he would tell him thank you very much. But much more poignant was his response to Ageyo on what he wished Kenyans would know so that they can approve of him.', 'Even if they do not approve of me, so what? At my age you approve me for what purpose?', 'Few people however appear to remember the Kivuitu of the pre-2007 mess.

It will be unfair to me and to the country for me to run the full course. The same fellows crying for the extension of my term will be singing the same song, Kivuitu said then and added: What is the use of leaving the Commission to go and die?', 'He had set himself higher ambitions of international stature as well as personal ones he wanted to achieve before his mortal coil was shuffled. He was also keen to leave a Commission whose integrity was unquestionable.', 'Kivuitu then argued, he had after many years of flipping the pages, discovered the wonder of the bible, the deep-seated wisdom and knowledge therein, things Id never known about. He had finally discovered Jesus!', 'Accordingly, he said he wanted to study theology for personal gratification: Ive grown to fear God and I guess that is one of the qualifications which the late Chesoni saw when he recruited me.

I contested and won back my seat which I held until the infamous Mlolongo of 1988 was introduced, he once narrated.', 'He was on record severally for dismissing the 1988 elections as the most bogus elections in the history of the country. He used to claim it was only patronage and money that won that particular election.', 'They said I didnt have money and I couldnt be helped each and every election. The late Mulu Mutisya called to tell me it was decided that I quit and go beg the president to get me another job... I told him I was not jobless!

But even before the election, Kivuitu appeared to have a strong sense of what was due to come.', 'During the Kiss 100 interview with Caroline Mutoko, Kivuitu with a lot of conviction said the contest then pitting Raila against Kibaki was tribally inspired more than anything else: We know the two parallels involved in these elections but we cant say. We know... and when you look at them, there is nothing between them.', 'He complained that he had been dragged into the two parallels because of his straightforwardness and speaking his mind on the issues.', 'If I see you have got one eye. I will tell you that you have got one eye and not two. If I see you are gluttonous and you want to eat alone, I will tell you exactly that. It is your gluttony that I hate, not you, he said.', 'He added, After all, I have got six sons and four of them have married from Central province. Now if I were that tribal, I would be kicking them around...we kwenda huko, you married a Kikuyu... its all nonsense!', 'But like many perpetual optimists who had decided to ignore Prof Makau Mutuas doom predictions during the December 12, 2007 Law Society of Kenya annual dinner that elections would inevitably lead to violence, Kivuitu soldiered on.', 'He would later defend himself by saying that violence was inevitable regardless of whoever he declared the winner.', 'Despite being indicted heavily on the court of public opinion over how he handled the 2007 election, Kivuitu hang on and said he would not resign. ', 'Never! I cannot resign otherwise I will be seen as coward which Im not.', 'At the Waki Commission, Kivuitu remained unapologetic over his results are being cooked remarks. He told lawyer Mumbi Ngugi, now a judge, that he thought Kenyans had known his way of speaking since he became the chairman and that he did not mean anything sinister:', 'Thats the way I speak and everybody speaks his way. Thats how I was taught by my grandfather and Im too old to change. I now hear my language might not have been appropriate but what to do?', 'Away from the commission and elections, Kivuitu was very proud of the Kenyan people whom he used to say were more hard-working than any other people he had ever seen.', 'When you go to some of these other countries, you will find them loitering aimlessly like dogs and practically doing nothing but when you come to Kenya, you will find them busy and toiling in one aspect or the other.', 'He had grown to love elections and once confessed that his greatest satisfaction was seeing people queuing to vote in polling stations: I feel like a farmer when he sees his cows coming home after a day long in the fields.', 'He fought many wars. When the government attempted to control the referendum calendar in 2005, he threatened to put it on the first day:', 'The law grants us 90 days to conduct it and its our business to decide when. In fact if they show their arrogance, I will put it on the first day of those 90 and they will take me nowhere.', 'As a student leader in Tanzania in the early 1960s, Kivuitu told off former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere when he came selling his one-party system to the students: Mr President, when you become a dictator, please come and address us!', 'He had little respect for the Kenyan political parties: They are run like personal properties. Each party has a owner. None of them can even qualify for elementary qualifications of a political party if it was so required.', 'Kivuitus health started deteriorating in 2007 and is partly the reason he was hesitant about a fresh five-year term. He told the Kriegler Commission that he was ailing all through the election period but braved it all.', 'After his commission was disbanded in 2008, Kivuitu retreated to his Garden Estate home where under increased isolation, his health worsened.', ' He nevertheless remained the most visible disgraced ECK commissioner walking in the streets, attending forums and helping the new electoral body pick up the groove.', 'After he was diagnosed with the cancer of oesophagus last year, he concentrated on his health and flew to India for treatment. When Ageyo interviewed him two weeks ago, Kivuitu said he was recovering well and that he hoped to be around some more.', 'He has authored several books among them Digest on Important Election cases (1993-1999) and Election Handbook for Political Parties and candidates on Parliamentary and Civic Elections.', 'During the 2007 Kiss 100 interview, Kivuitu was asked by Caroline Mutoko how he wanted Kenyans to remember him after all the contribution.

They remained fictitious up until my young and quite impressionable cousin started pointing out to me the signs and symbols of the Illuminati in every music video we happened to be watching together. ', 'Reluctant as I was to believe in the existence of the Illuminati, I began noticing certain patterns  the repetitions and similarities in every music video. For instance, the triangular, diamond-like shape seen often when these celebrities touch the index fingers and thumbs of both hands together. This shape is also seen a special effect in other videos packaged as entertainment for the masses. It is speculated that this is the sign of the womb where life begins while others claim it is the sign of the pyramid as seen on the US dollar bill and as such those who make this symbol are staking their claim and control over world resources.', ""As far-fetched as it all sounds, Dr Justin Adiyb's book offers even more alarming statements on the Illuminati, Freemasons and other such organisations. Sample the following statement as extracted from the book: The Jesuit priests are blood-thirsty, power-hungry satanists whose only interests is money and power... they were the force behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.. they have destroyed nations, started wars and murdered rulers and presidents. And yet another statement: Note for all Muslims: The Koran that you hold in your hands today is not the original Koran."", ""Illuminati is real, Adiyb says. They have infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Take the visa card for example. VI is Roman for six. The letter 'S' is sigma for six while 'A' is the ancient Babylonian symbol for six. Put together it (Visa) translates to 666."", ""Adiyb further adds that smart cards, used to buy goods here in Kenya and elsewhere, are another method employed by the Illuminati in their quest to control the planet. Incidentally, yet another symbol of the Illuminati is the 'seeing eye' also prominent on the dollar bill at the apex of a pyramid. According to Adiyb, the implication of this can be summed up in four words:"", 'Big brother is watching - watching and seeing everything all the time. The seeing eye is also the symbol of deity, some believe it is the eye of God but some believe it is the eye of Lucifer  the all seeing god of the universe On the other hand, the five pointed star is a symbol of Satan.', 'Apparently, a great number of the members of the Order of the Illuminati come through Freemasonry. The head of the Illuminati at the present time are the Rothchilds  a powerful family with unlimited resources ranging in the trillions. ', 'Directly under them is the Council of 13, also known as the Grand Druid Council. Directly under is the Council of 33 - these are the highest Freemasons in the world, and under them is the Council of 500  the richest people in the world often listed in the Forbes 500 list.', ' Jay Z, Beyonce, Rihanna are not among the 500 richest people in the world but they are the lesser luminaries who contribute to the chaos of the Illuminati, says Adiyb of some of the performing artistes suspected to be part of the Illuminati. The higher hierarchies of the Illuminati use these lesser luminaries who are very influential to spread and infiltrate into every aspect our lives.', 'Still according to Adiyb, in the US, the Illuminati are now in the process of destroying stored food and farmlands. Thus, the only food that will be available will be in Federal Houses and people will therefore have to depend on the Federal Government for everything. In Africa, the Illuminati have allegedly brought in Monsanto  the world leading manufacturer of genetically modified seeds and companion pesticide.', ""Monsanto seeds are genetically modified and are designed to contaminated all other normal crops in your field, writes Adiyb in his book. This means that once your field is contaminated you will not be able to grow normal seeds, only Monsanto seeds will grow. Monsanto are part of the Illuminati plan to control the world's food supply."", 'Monsanto maize was been banned in France and was later overturned by EU on the basis that there was no scientific evidence on its inviability. Thus if Monsanto were to be adapted in Africa, Adiyb says it will be part of the greater Illuminati plan to control world affairs through governments and corporations for the purpose of establishing a new world order.', 'Movie producers are the lesser luminaries contributing to the chaos. Adiyb asserts that the movie industry is a part of the Illuminati plan. Phonetically the first three letters of cinema, C-I-N means Sin which is exactly what is encouraged in movies.', 'Indeed, a lot of the information in this book does sound far-fetched and aside from mentioning certain Kenyan artiste known to use some of the Illuminati symbols, the implications of Illuminati on East Africa is not clearly brought out. However, Adiyb promises a sequel where perhaps what is unclear in this book will be be made clear in the next.', 'The Illuminati and Freemasonry in East Africa is available in select bookshops at Sh1,300.', 'Stars: 3', '\n']"

It is a tribute, says the smiling chief executive of Safaricom, Kenyas biggest mobile phone network, to the fact his customers have no intention of switching provider.', 'When he stopped unlimited data use last year, he received offensive messages. Some customers bombarded him on Twitter; others set up hate websites. His decision was partly to limit the scope for hate speech ahead of the March 4 elections. For two weeks I was spawn of the devil, he says. Two years ago I would have been a little bit upset about it and taken it personally. But people have short memories  Ill move on and tomorrow Ill be a hero.', 'As head of Safaricom, which is 40 per cent owned by Vodafone of the UK, the 55-year-old leads a company seen as a national institution but that is often accused of monopolistic tendencies. Collymore uses the word dominant before correcting himself. Why dont we call it ubiquitous ... I think thats a nice word.', 'For the Guyana-born Collymore, this means he is a celebrity. They put this whole celebrity thing on me here ... you dont have a choice. I cant imagine many corporate leaders in any other part of the world  Richard Branson maybe  who are instantly recognised, he says.', 'The same was true for his predecessor, Michael Joseph, whom Collymore describes as a benevolent dictator. He says he was a little more inclusive but soon found himself adopting a similar approach. Michael and I are worryingly similar.', 'Safaricom has 19 million customers in a country of 40 million, which translates to nearly every adult. It reported revenues of Sh116.5 billion ($1.3 billion) last year and has developed an international reputation for innovation.', 'One reason is that for many Kenyans a mobile connection is much more than a telephone. It is also a substitute office and bank account, thanks to Safaricoms M-Pesa, a money transfer system named after the Swahili word for money that allows customers to send cash via text message. The service is used by 15 million customers to buy everything from sugar to flights, at an average 80 transactions a second. It is so successful that 31 per cent of Kenyas GDP washes through the system, and it has been exported to India and Qatar.', 'The companys latest initiative is M-Shwari, a savings and lending service. Theres Sh200 billion-Sh300 billion sitting in mattresses or locked boxes. At the moment, if your shack goes up in flames so does your money, he says of the appeal of interest-earning M-Shwari accounts.', 'His statement may be all too prescient. Five years ago, 100,000 homes were burnt or looted when disputed elections sent the country into a tailspin. Allegations of vote-rigging triggered violence that killed more than 1,300 people and displaced more than 600,000. Growth in east Africas biggest economy plummeted to an annual rate of 1.5 per cent from seven per cent a year earlier.', 'In the hope of avoiding a repeat of such chaos, Safaricom will for the first time relay results directly from polling stations to tallying centres, and is already sending out election education messages to some of the countrys 14 million registered voters. We are a huge part of democracy, says Collymore, who expects flare-ups but no 2008-style meltdown. It will be much tougher [to rig].', 'While his biggest nightmare is always the outage of M-Pesa, which slows when demand spikes, he worries the entire network may overload during the election. Weve got a plan of action ... we have to keep the country communicating ... and we have to keep money flowing, he says.', 'The greater risk for the country is a political deficit, and after the election he says he will focus on combating corruption. We have to get rid of corruption in Africa  Africa could be such a great investment destination if we can just deal with those issues, he says. Young people feel economically, politically, socially disempowered  and that is being vented in a few places but not vented in the places it should matter.', 'He points to events in the Middle East and north Africa as a potential harbinger of what could happen in Kenya. The thing that triggered the Arab spring was not political; it was social discontent. The gap between rich and poor here is growing ... and that, I think, presents us with a bigger challenge.', 'Collymore, who watches Kenyas evolving political scenarios as if he is a citizen himself, has made quick work of becoming a national champion, and regularly appeals to national sentiment despite his British-Guyanan background. Now I say, me Im Kenyan, me, he says, teasing out a typical turn of phrase. Many Kenyans seem to appreciate his efforts: he was awarded the Moran of the Burning Spear by the president last year  a prize rarely given to foreigners  was presented with a goat for his birthday and is often urged to get a piece of land in keeping with local tradition.', 'Collymores ability to adapt to new contexts was nurtured from an early age. He was raised by his grandparents in Guyana for 12 years and when he was 16 his mother, who had moved to the UK, brought him to join her in London. As the only black child in his class, he tried to be wallpaper to avoid getting beaten up. I didnt even know what the word wog was until I got there. I didnt know what racial abuse was, he says.', 'After school, he had to forgo a place at Warwick University because he was not eligible for funding. I wanted to go to university and I disliked not having gone and for some years after I wished Id gone, he says. Now it doesnt matter, [but] I would always advise a young person to go to the best university you can find.', 'When graduates ask for his advice, however, he preaches the value of being able to adapt, an attribute that has driven his own career. Unable to pursue a degree, Collymore spent his time filling forms as a junior underwriter and working as a train announcer while pursuing his passion for surrealist stuff.', 'Were it not for his mother, he might still be selling his oil paintings along the railings of Hyde Park. But she joked she would evict him unless he got a serious job and got him an interview at British Telecom, where she worked. He was given an entry-level job as a clerical officer.', 'His career took off when he joined the UKs Cellnet in 1993, just as the corporate world was starting to venture into mobile telephony. I was walking down a path no one else had walked and I thought, this is good because the rules arent written and Im just going to make the rules up as I go, he says. We took some risks. This change thing  it is actually quite exciting, its good, and you will make mistakes and you will stumble and fall and thats quite neat.', 'The hankering after new ground and love of adaptability has served him well.

Actually, Raila instituted a private prosecution that was predictably snuffed out by AG Amos Wako. During the debate Raila could have done himself real good by at least pointing to that private prosecution. One cannot understand why he just kept mum. Had the late Saitoti been a candidate, the matter would have been really politically embarrassing despite his having been exonerated by the High Court.', 'Uhuru did himself a lot of good to appear for the second debate for he would have had coward written all over himself. His opponents would have had a field day with the land mater, and he would not have been in a position to be able to directly rebut any brickbats that came his way. Perhaps his threat not to attend was just some ploy of sorts. Did his appearance at the debate help his image? It at least created the impression that he was not evading the limelight in some discomfiture. Uhuru in the end did not come out badly but neither was the matter resolved if you want to put it that way.', 'Will it now recede into the background? Probably not. He tried his best to explain his position through the willing buyer, willing seller line and that it has been dealt with via the declaration of wealth required of public officers. This is much like Mitt Romney declining to make public his annual tax returns save for two years. Uhuru did not dispel the impression that he and his family sit on immensely huge tracts of land acquired by proximity to power, specifically by his father having been the Head of State for 15 years. Is that illegal? May be not. Is it an issue politically and morally? Politically yes.', 'Morally it may depend on where you are, but that it is potent politically is indicated by reports that the Kenyatta family has ceded 4,000 acres in Taveta. And that is precisely the matter. If you can cede that much land, then how much do you own? How did you come to own 4,000 acres in Taveta? Who were the immediate previous owners? If these owners were departing colonial settlers should the land not have gone to Tavetans? How were other tracts of land acquired? This is the line of questioning that Martha Karua should have taken. As a very strong presidential contender, why was Uhuru largely quite about the delay in the appointment of the land commission?', 'Paul Muite did himself a lot of good by proposing that some leases of large tracts of land in the Rift Valley should not be renewed on the expiry of the 99 year period so that the pieces can be used to settle the landless in those areas.', 'Uhuru and Raila did not do themselves much good when it came out that feuds between the Finance and Lands ministries which are probably at the centre of some of the shortcomings in the resettlement of IDPs.', 'Dida touched on a raw nerve in Central Province, i.e the land that those perceived to have been members of or supporters of the Mau Mau lost to the so-called home guards and loyalists. The latter classes were no doubt quite close to Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Raila was right, the betrayal of the aspirations of freedom fighters and other concomitant historical injustices cannot be blamed on Uhuru. The commission of the original sin, if at all, lies elsewhere.', 'Much as the Salaries and Remuneration Commission is a constitutional body that cannot be dictated to, it is not convincing for presidential candidates to be seeming to be leaving everything in regard to the salaries of state and public officers to the commission, especially when its recent proposals on the pay of state officers appear to be signalling business as usual.', 'Kibaki was a compromise candidate in 2002 not because he is gentle but because he was also the strongest among the people supporting him. Through the NAK he had managed to bring together no less than 12 political parties including his DP, FORD-Kenya, and NPK. The LDP brigade of Raila, Kalonzo, and Awori had no choice but to endorse him since the very act of departing Kanu and actually joining the opposition that they had hitherto scoffed at, had in a way weakened them.', 'You do not seek refuge in a neighbour s house and think that you can call the shots there. Kibaki had since his loss to Moi, having come in at a strong second remained steadfast as leader of the opposition while Raila had his NDP dissolved to join Kanu. Mudavadi who wants to paint himself as a Kibaki of sorts with a gentlemanly mien should pay attention to Kibakis bare knuckled campaign in 1997.', 'In the 2013 general election, it is Raila and not Mudavadi who is the compromise candidate, and it is precisely because he is stronger than Mudavadi, with the latter apparently being a very poor student of Kenyan political history despite having been in its midst for over two decades. Coincidentally, Raila is in 2013 a compromise candidate facing Uhuru as his strongest opponent just like KIbaki faced the latter as a compromise candidate in 2002. In contrast to the departure from Kanu by the LDP troop, Mudavadi vacated ODM almost alone. At least William Ruto left with his colleagues from North and Central Rift and beyond in tow. If Ruto and Uhuru were not willing to have the much stronger Kalonzo as their compromise candidate, how were they going to settle for Mudavadi? ', '\n']"

http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2013/03/02/implications-of-a-kenyatta-and-ruto-presidency_c739226,IMPLICATIONS OF A KENYATTA AND RUTO PRESIDENCY,www.the-star.co.ke › Siasa,"Mar. 02, 2013, 12:00 am","['This is a shortened version of a report prepared jointly by the Kenyan Section of the International Commission of Jurists, Katiba Institute and The Kenya Human Rights Commission.', 'I. Background', 'Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto, both of whom face charges of crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Court, have declared that they will seek office as president and deputy president in Kenyas general election scheduled for March 4, 2013.', ' II. Introduction', 'As Kenya gears up for elections in 2013, the politicisation of the cases before the ICC threatens the elections and has become a major electoral issue.', 'This is because notwithstanding the fact that they face charges before the ICC, two of the accused persons, Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto had each maintained that they would run for president in those elections.', 'This report seeks to answer the question as to what would be the implications of a Kenyatta/Ruto presidency in view of the cases against the two before the ICC.', 'The report considers that the international implications have been covered well in other literature and while they are also covered in the report, it is the domestic implications that are given the greatest prominence.', 'The report assumes that if Kenyatta and Ruto became president while facing charges before the ICC, they would choose to continue their cooperation with the court and so would go to The Hague for their trial.', 'Accordingly, the report does not address what would happen if, as is also possible, they chose not to cooperate with the court having assumed Kenyas ultimate leadership.', 'The report endeavours to show that, like everybody else that works, the president has a daily job. The report therefore seeks to show the ways in which the presidents daily job would be affected by an ICC trial.', 'It needs to be pointed out that under both the Rome statute of the ICC, and Kenyan law, one is presumed innocent until proved guilty. Kenyatta and Ruto must be given the full benefit of this legal position, and this report should not be understood as trying in any way to depart from this legal position.', 'However, the effects that a trial before the ICC would have on their presidency is a practical matter and raises questions that must be fully appreciated by the country as it goes to the elections.', 'The report is divided into three sections. The first section identifies the presidents daily job, and the attributes that the president is assumed to have under the constitution.', 'The second part discusses the effects on domestic affairs, if Kenyatta and Ruto were to be elected as president and the third discusses the international implications. There is a brief conclusion that follows at the end of these discussions.', 'POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS IF UHURU KENYATTA OR WILLIAM RUTO IS', 'ELECTED PRESIDENT', 'Part 2: The Domestic Level', '1. The Oath of Office', 'Article 141 of the constitution provides that the President-elect assumes office by taking and subscribing the oath or affirmation of allegiance, and the oath or affirmation for the execution of the functions of office, as prescribed in the constitution.', 'Further, article 74, which deals with ethics and integrity, provides that a state officer, who includes the president and deputy president, before assuming a state office, shall take and subscribe the oath or affirmation of office.', 'Kenyas elections take place on March 4, 2013 and if there is no person qualified to be declared a winner a runoff will be held between the first two candidates. The runoff is currently scheduled to take place on or about April 10, 2012, the same time that trials for', 'Kenyatta and Ruto commence in The Hague. If there is no winner in the first round and a runoff is necessary, and if the two or one of them is elected as president or deputy president, during such a runoff, this will lead to difficult choices for the country.', 'On the one hand a person cannot assume office as president or deputy president before subscribing to an oath of office and on the other hand they will not be in Kenya at that time to take such an oath. The choices will be:', 'a) To absent themselves from trial so as to take an oath of office;', 'b) To attend their trial and keep the country waiting for when they will next be available to take their oath of office, and therefore assume office. It follows that the act of setting up a government following the elections will also be delayed as the two cannot legally appoint the government until they are president.', 'After a highly difficult set of elections, Kenya may remain leaderless if its president has to abandon the election process midway and go to The Hague for trial.', 'Alternatively, the president defying the ICC will remain in the country to take the oath of office. It is unlikely that he will thereafter submit to trial before the International Criminal Court.', '2. On Executive Authority', 'The constitution provides that the president and the deputy president constitute the executive authority of the government. In practice the executive authority is exercised through the cabinet which is made of the president, deputy president and cabinet secretaries.', 'By tradition the cabinet meets once every week and provides overall leadership to the entire government. If either Kenyatta or Ruto is elected president or deputy president, he will be forced to be permanently absent from meetings of the cabinet while attending trial in The Hague. This is undesirable and would lead to a situation where the heart of the government will operate without leadership and direction.', '3. On the armed forces', ""The president is the commander-in-chief of the Armed forces. A commander-in-chief is the person exercising supreme command authority of a nation's military forces."", 'Currently, Kenyas military is involved in the war against al Shabaab in Somalia. Also, as a result of the vastly deteriorated security situation within Kenya, the military is, for the first time in the history of the country, involved in law enforcement and peacekeeping responsibilities within Kenya.', 'As part of this there is an on-going security operation led by the military following the attack in Baragoi, Turkana, which led to the massacre of more than 40 police officers.', 'Also, the military is involved in the pacification of Garissa following the influx of al Shabaab elements who have been responsible for the killing of more than four soldiers in isolated terrorist attacks.', 'It is fair to say that the situation in relation to the fight against al Shabaab is highly dynamic and although there is increased pacification of lawless Somalia, there is increasing evidence that threats by al Shabaab are increasingly being staged on Kenyan soil, either in Garissa, or within the city of Nairobi.', 'Since the prevailing security situation remains fluid, it would be desirable that the commander-inchief remains personally engaged in the management of what may happen.', 'Secondly, it is simply inconceivable and highly offensive to military honour, that the commander-in-chief is a person facing prosecution in a court of law.', 'Thirdly, the president is at the heart of the national security architecture. At the lowest level, the security apparatus is the district security committee made of security operatives at that level.', 'At the highest level is the cabinet security committee, which is chaired by the vice president and includes the Minister for Internal Security, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Head of the Public Service.', 'The committee directly advises the president on security matters in the country, and takes overall responsibility for the wellbeing of the country.', 'As part of this, only the president, with the approval of the National Assembly, can declare a state of emergency. Also, only the president can declare a war.', 'The power to declare a state of emergency or war is an extension of the presidents role as the commander in chief. This is why the president is at the centre of the national security information.', 'If the president or the deputy president is to go to The Hague for trial, this will have direct and profound effects on the security situation in the country, as both of them have direct roles in this regard.', '4. On Diplomatic Relations', ""The president is at the heart of diplomatic relations. According to universal diplomatic practice, ambassadors, high commissioners, and other representatives of foreign governments are not authorised to represent their governments until their credentials have been formally presented in person and have been accepted by the host government's head of state."", 'A diplomat whose credentials are accepted is regarded to have been accredited to the host government and is considered an officer of the host government as well as his own.', 'This protocol has been codified in the constitution which provides that the president receives diplomatic and consular representatives. In practice, when foreign diplomats arrive in Kenya, they remain inactive and cannot meet with any representatives of the Kenya government, until they have presented their credentials to the president.', 'If the president or the deputy president has to be away for trial, there will be profound and direct effects on diplomatic practice as has been practiced until now.', '5. On the presidents role in the legislative process', 'The president assents to all bills enacted by Parliament before these become law. In 2011, the president assented to 34 bills which thereby became law.', 'In 2012, the president has so far assented to 31 bills. It is expected that as Kenya implements the constitution, Parliament will remain busy in enacting the necessary legislation to give effect to the constitution.', 'After the elections in 2013, Parliament will have two chambers, the National Assembly and the Senate, in place of the one chamber that has existed until now.', 'Since each of the Houses can originate legislation, the legislative agenda may become even busier. Further, as the passing of legislation will involve two houses, rather than one, as has been the case until now, the legislative processes will become longer and more bureaucratic. Presidential assent to bills must be done within 14 days and these must be published within seven days thereafter.', 'The constitution confers on the president a veto power over bills enacted by Parliament. Where the president declines to assent to a bill, he must refer it back to Parliament explaining the reasons that led to the refusal to assent.', 'Parliament can override the Presidents objections if the Bill, as originally passed, receives the support of 2/3 of the members of the National Assembly, and, in case it has implications on devolution, 2/3 of the members of the Senate.', 'The power to veto bills is a check on legislative excesses. During his term in office President Mwai Kibaki has exercised this power thrice: in 2009 he queried aspects of the Fiscal Management Act.', 'The bill had been sponsored in Parliament by a private member. As a result of the presidents interventions, the bill was altered, after which he signed it into law.', 'In 2012 the president refused to assent to the Finance Bill 2012 in which Members of Parliament had awarded themselves a generous severance pay of Sh.9.3 million each.', 'Earlier in 2012 the President refused to assent to the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2012 because the bill proposed to amend the Political Parties Act 2011, to allow for continued party hopping by Members of Parliament.', 'The President observed that the matter of the consequences of defecting from political parties or changing allegiance between parties was already the subject of court petitions further noting that matters which are before the court should not be the subject of legislation by the National Assembly.', 'It will require an engaged president to support the realisation of the provisions of the constitution as regards the legislative process. This is partly because the timelines for assent and publication of legislation are tight and also because a disengaged president exposes the country to parliamentary tyranny as he cannot exercise the veto power effectively.', 'As the country continues to implement the new constitution, heavy reliance will continue to be placed on an efficient legislative process.', 'An absentee president will not add to such efficiency. Also, the fact that the country will have a second chamber of the legislature, creating a new experience in the legislative process makes it more compelling for the president to be fully engaged in this process.', '6. On the Presidents other relationships with Parliament', 'Under the constitution, the president will no longer be a Member of Parliament. However, the president still has other relationships with Parliament outside of the legislative process.', 'The president is required to make an address at the opening of every newly elected Parliament, and at least once a year thereafter. This is the constitutional mechanism that will enable the president to communicate to brief parliament as to his policy intentions and overall leadership direction.', 'As things stand, there is a danger that if elected as president, Kenyatta or Ruto will not make even the maiden address as he will already be away on trial. Thereafter, the president will remain disconnected with Parliament and there will be a policy and leadership gap resulting from this.', '7. On cabinet meetings', 'The president chairs cabinet meetings once every week. This represents an intensive work programme. In addition, cabinet has several sub-committees of itself which are advisory to the entire cabinet and to the president.', 'Since the president is at the centre of cabinet affairs, it is unthinkable how cabinet would operate when faced with a long absence of the president from the country.', '8. On the devolved government', 'The president is directly involved in the management of the devolved governments. The president may suspend a county government in an emergency arising out of internal conflict or war; or in any other exceptional circumstances.', 'A county government can only be suspended if an independent commission of inquiry has investigated allegations against the county government, and the president is satisfied that the allegations are justified and the Senate has authorised the suspension.', 'Such suspension lasts for only 90 days, and thereafter, there must be elections to constitute a new county government. The Intergovernmental Relations Act puts the president at the centre of the relations between the national and county governments.', 'It establishes the National and County Government Co-ordinating Summit as the apex body for intergovernmental relations. The summit comprises the president, or in the absence of the president, the deputy president, as the chair, and the governors of the forty-seven counties.', 'The summit promotes co-operation between the national and county governments and gives policy direction to other coordinating levels such as the Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee and the sectoral working groups or committees.', 'Devolution of power, which has led to the creation of 47 counties and their governments, is by far the most ambitious set of provisions in the new constitution.', '9. On the nomination, appointment and removal of constitution office holders', 'Under the former constitution, the appointment of persons to fill most of the important constitution office holders was the sole preserve of the president.', 'The constitution of Kenya, 2010, makes the appointment of these constitution office holders a collaborative exercise between the president and other organs of the state, including Parliament and the Judicial Service Commission.', 'For example, the president appoints the chief justice and the deputy chief justice, in accordance with the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission, and subject to the approval of the National Assembly.', 'Also the constitution expands the category of offices, the filling of which is the subject of this collaborative approach. For example the appointment of members of all the independent commissions established under the constitution involves this special procedure of appointment.', 'Further, the constitution also makes the removal from office of certain persons that have been appointed to these offices the subject of collaboration between the president and other organs.', 'For example, the National Assembly may, by resolution, require the president to remove a cabinet secretary from office. The removal process is subject to investigation by, and the recommendation of, a committee of the National Assembly.', 'An absentee president will be forced to helplessly follow from outside the country, lengthy removal proceedings as they go on in Kenya.', 'The very nature of the appointment and removal process, therefore, requires significant and direct engagement on the part of the president.', 'For example, the Independent Office Holders Act, 2010, passed to provide a roadmap for the appointment of the Controller of Budget and the Auditor General, puts the president at the centre of the appointment process by requiring him to commence the appointment process within seven days after the occurrence of a vacancy in these offices.', 'The president thereafter nominates a candidate for appointment and the National Assembly may reject such a candidate in which case the president is required to name a fresh candidate from among those that had been interviewed. This is demonstrably a very involved process.', 'A long absence from the country for any reason would have an effect on the capacity to collaborate in the filing of these positions. Also, the removal process involves the personal judgment of the president, who must make the decision that a particular removal is called for.', 'It would be difficult for a disengaged president to make this decision. Secondly, as vacancies arise all the time, it is not possible to plan around the presidents absence on how these are to be managed.', '10. On the administration of Justice', 'The post-election violence gave rise to horrendous crimes, the bulk of which have unfortunately remained unpunished. While the ICC trials are intended to bring justice in relation to persons regarded as bearing the greatest responsibility for crimes committed during the post-election violence, it is to be expected that national processes will seek accountability against other persons alleged to have committed crimes during the violence.', 'This is based on the fact that the ICC is a court of last resort and prosecutes only when national processes have failed or are unable to do so.', 'The Kenya government is current following several prongs, including a task force appointed by the Director of Public Prosecutions, that suggest a commitment to prosecute these crimes.', 'It would be incongruent for Kenya to pursue national prosecutions against crimes of the post-election violence with the president and deputy president also undergoing trial abroad.', 'There would be no confidence that the president and deputy president can provide full political support for prosecutions in which they are also part of the accused group.', 'Another prong that the country has been following in the search for justice is the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission whose mandate, deliberately covers the period of the post-election violence.', 'After more than three years of work, the Commission is currently writing its report which is expected to be released this year. Persons facing charges for post-election violence crimes would not be ideally placed to offer ultimate leadership on the implementation of the report.', 'Part 3: The International Level', '1. International Relations', 'Kenya strives to be an upright member of the international community and has joined several multilateral arrangements such as the East African Community, the African Union, and the United Nations.', 'If ICC suspects became president, this will exert strains in the existing foreign relations at several levels. It has been suggested that if the two fail to attend their trial, they will be restricted to travelling only within certain countries in Africa and will be unable to travel outside of the continent for fear of arrest.', 'This assertion is based on the experiences of Sudanese President, Omar el Bashir, against whom the ICC has issued two arrest warrants and who has had to curtail travel to a few countries for fear of arrest. ', 'The assertion is only partially correct. It is correct in stating that Kenyatta and Ruto will be unable to travel outside of Africa but incorrect in assuming that they can travel to any African country.', 'In July 2012, the AU summit scheduled to be held in Malawi had to be moved to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia after President Joyce Banda made it clear that her country was unable to host President Bashir as to do so would have violated Malawis obligation as a member of the ICC, to arrest the President if he should travel to the country.', 'Malawi was not the first African country to refuse to host President Bashir for the same reason: South Africa and Botswana have made it clear that should Bashir be found on their soil, he would be arrested and handed over to the ICC.', 'Also, Uganda has twice failed to assure Bashir of his safety from arrest leading to a decision by him not to travel to Uganda. The fact that Uganda takes seriously her responsibilities under the Rome statute is potentially problematic for Kenya than any other country.', 'First, the two are contiguous and have very strong economic ties. Second, as both belong to the East African Community and IGAD, it would bring unimaginable difficulties in the two organisations if the relationship between Kenya and Uganda was to become dysfunctional as a result of the cases facing its top leaders.', 'On its part, the United Nations has a policy not to relate with persons facing charges for international crimes. An opinion issued in 2006 by the UN legal advisor on Peace and Justice in Post-Conflict SocietiesThe UN Position states as follows:', 'Contacts between UN representatives and person indicted by international criminal jurisdictions holding positions of authority in their respective countries should be limited to what is strictly required for carrying out UN mandated activities.', 'The presence of any UN representatives in any ceremonial or similar occasion with such individuals should be avoided. When contacts are absolutely necessary, an attempt should be made to interact with non-indicted individuals of the same group or party.', 'Some western countries have also taken strong individual positions regarding interactions with persons facing charges like those that Kenyatta and Ruto do.', 'These positions will affect Kenyas relationship with those countries if either Kenyatta or Ruto becomes president. For example, on August 4, 2011 US President Barack Obama signed a proclamation giving power to the Secretary of State to prevent the entry into the US of persons who participate in serious human rights and humanitarian law and related violations.', 'The proclamation suspends entry into the United States, as immigrants or non-immigrants, of any alien who planned, ordered, assisted, aided and abetted, committed or otherwise participated in, including through command responsibility, war crimes, crimes against humanity or other serious violations of human rights, or who attempted or conspired to do so.', 'While the US has not actually put measures to implement this proclamation in relation to Kenyatta and Ruto, this will almost certainly happen if the two defy the ICC whether or not any of them is elected president.', 'Some European countries have adopted a similar approach which will severely limit the movement of Kenyatta and Ruto if elected president.', 'CONCLUSION', 'Kenya enacted a new constitution in 2010 which is the sum of the collective experiences of the country. The constitution represents shared aspirations as to peace justice and prosperity, but also represents shared aspiration that violence such as has been experienced in Kenyas politics in the recent past, will be a thing of the past.', 'The forthcoming elections provide a good opportunity to consolidate the aspirations that made the country vote so overwhelmingly for the new constitution, and also the chance to demonstrate that the country has learnt something from the recent violence.', 'As demonstrated in the report, the next president of Kenya will have a more demanding role in running the countrys affairs and offering leadership.', 'After the elections Kenya will re-align its governance structure with the constitution and the newly elected leaders in the categories of county representatives, women representative, senate representative, members of parliament, deputy president and president.', 'This is a significant shift on governance for the country and therefore equally demanding for the leadership of the country to ensure that the new sructures are implemented effectively as anticipated by the constitution.', 'It follows that a fully dedicated leadership cannot be overlooked. Also, it is to be hoped that the report of the Truth Justice and Reconciliation Commission will be released soon after the next elections and that the report will set an agenda for justice for victims of the post-election violence, including the provision of reparations.', 'In such a case, the president and deputy president would be expected to lead the implementation of the agenda. However, it would be practically difficult for them to do so effectively while facing a trial.', 'Further, victims may not have confidence in the leadership that they will provide. As indicated above national trials for post-election crimes are expected to occur after the next elections.', 'A president and deputy president facing charges before the ICC would be in a position of conflict if heading a government that is also prosecuting crimes of a kind that the president and deputy president face.', 'This report affirms the innocence of Kenyatta and Ruto until they are proved guilty upon trial, the fact of being accused persons places practical limitations on their lives which in turn make it impractical that they can run a country.', 'Also, their status as accused persons places them in positions of conflict with victims of crimes who expect justice, and also with other government functionaries who are required to cooperate in their prosecution and at the same time pay them allegiance as the top leaders of Kenya.', 'For the reasons canvassed in this report, presidency by persons facing prosecution before the ICC would be inherently problematic. A presidency by Kenyatta is likely to hobble Kenya as it would be impossible to conduct national affairs while the president is away on trial.', 'In the event of non-cooperation in the trial another chapter of difficulties will be opened for the country. While Kenyans have the right to elect whoever they want, and while it would be necessary to respect democratic choices, this will not take away these well-founded concerns. ', '\n']"

Telecom is extremely capital intensive business where we are forced to bring in a lot of money much before yet for returns come in in five to eight years time. We have already invested $500 million in Kenya. Our promoters (Essar) have just put in close to $150 million in to the business and that has been paid off to the banks.

We produce millions of minute a day. From the billions of minutes a month you can always drive economies of scale which otherwise you can not do with other kinds of business like FMCG.

If you decide to do business on lower margins and you are confident that you will be able to get more scale(subscribers) then that is fine. Its also depends the speed at which you grow, and you have to keep costs low.', 'How will you manage to keep the costs low, given telecom is a capital intensive business?', 'Also 94 per cent of our sites are electrified, which is much cheaper than diesel.

You will have to give me time to consult the national committee in-charge of fixtures and even the national chairman, said Terry.', 'The teams, most of which area self-supporting, are gearing up for the season set to kick off mid this month and have been meeting to plan on how they will collaborate to ensure matches being played up-country run smoothly.', '\n']"
