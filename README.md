# Kentan-Election-Riots-Analytics
A national election is due to take place in Kenya on 8/8/2017.  Previous elections particularly the ones in 2013 have given rise to much violence (riots) in the country. And in the primaries for this election (in April 2017 two people died in the unrest that ensued).  This study seeks to predict violence in the upcoming elections with a computer model that takes as inputs publicly available sources such as news, social media, weather, socio-economic indicators, and other inputs proposed by the researcher.  Using historical data from 2013 (both the inputs and reports about violence) one might find correlations between sentiment in social media, particular themes used in the news, or the frequency of the mention of tribal names for instance with violence reported at particular times. That could provide a model for predictions in August 2017.  The model will remain valuable after this election and will be further developed for future elections in the country. Additional work might also be pursued to generalize the model for other countries as well.
