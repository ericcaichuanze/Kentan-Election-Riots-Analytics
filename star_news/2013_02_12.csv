Republic, Crim. App. No. 497 of 2007 are automatically a nullity.', ' Despite the expansion by the Court of Appeal regarding the issue of legal representation, it recognized the implications thereof and consequently the need to make major policy and legislative changes, and to make financial resources available in order to put into effect the constitutional requirement that accused persons be availed legal representation in situations where substantial injustice would result if the accused person was undefended, and for those charged with the offences that carry the death penalty.', ' The High Court can only try cases in which the law confers jurisdiction upon it, and there is no doubt about where jurisdiction for trial of robbery with violence cases lies.', 'The law has provided very clearly with regard to the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Courts to try the offence, and as long as the Magistrates Courts conduct trials within the parameters established under the law, there would be no basis for interfering with their mandate.', ' The intention behind the provision of Article 157 (10) of the Constitution was to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions carry out his constitutional mandate without interference from any person or organ, unless there was clear evidence of violation of a partys rights under the Constitution or violation of the Constitution itself.', 'If such an order was to be made, it would be in individual cases on the basis of very clear and cogent evidence that substantial injustice would result, and cannot be made as a blanket order in respect of all cases of robbery with violence.', ' Taking into account the practical implications to the public interest and the rights of the indigent persons, stopping the DPP from carrying out prosecutions until legal representation has been provided would not only be contrary to the societal interests in seeing those who have committed crimes brought to trial, but would also lead to violations of the rights of the accused persons themselves.', ' Regarding the State action on the right to legal representation, it is clear that necessary steps have already been undertaken to put in place measures required to provide legal representation as required under the provisions of Article 50 (2) (h) of the Constitution.', 'These include the drafting of a Legal Aid Policy and Bill, and the rolling out of pilot projects in various parts of the country for the provision of legal representation to indigent Kenyans.
