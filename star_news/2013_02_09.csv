They consider them flawless, that they never err and should they do anything wrong, their positions in society put them above criticism. But to understand the right of the media to criticise leaders, let me cite five main functions of any radio station.', 'Medias first responsibility is to inform their audiences or readership of whatever is happening in the country, good or bad. But in informing people of whatever they must observe fidelity to truth, however painful. But the pain of truth is like the pain of giving birth. It has sweet consequences. ', 'The second function of media is to educate its readership or audience on the many things in the world whose existence they dont know and if they do, they dont understand.', 'The third function of a radio station is to criticise society and leadership when they get lost. To do this, many radio stations allow their radios to serve as platforms for self-criticism or criticism of leaders. When society rejects self-criticism or criticism, it is like a human being that will not bathe. It stinks.', 'The forth function of a radio or television station is to entertain its audience with music, films, plays or narration of stories. In entertaining however, every station must not undermine by violating its dos and donts in order to undermine its culture or morally pervert its youth by exposing them to things that corrupt their behaviour and character. Media should therefore not promote pornography.', 'The fifth function of the media is to engage in advertising business selling its airtime as a commercial enterprise. But this business must be conducted through obedience to laws like the Public Procurement and Disposal Act. ', 'Nor should media use falsehood to promote profits. Since media are the ultimate critics, they should avoid corruption when they may not self-criticise.', 'In the days of one party dictatorship, people could not criticise leaders even if they walked naked in the market by denying them the right to use a government radio station like KBC whose only work was to praise the president, entertain him, spread his propaganda and broadcast news about him only. All news that the government media broadcast was to praise the president while denigrating and demonising political enemies.', 'Under Kenyatta, every KBC reporter who dared criticise the president would be taught a lesson while all people including KBC were all the time advised to chorus the presidents song like a parrot or risk being detained without trial.', 'Courtesy of our new constitution and democracy, a private radio station has a right to criticise any leader who does wrong but as the musician Munish will say, it is the right of those who listen to a radio not to listen to that criticism if it grates their ears.', 'In offering criticism to society, a radio station must not discriminate. It must not have those it will criticise with alacrity and sacred cows whom it will never criticise. ', 'When a radio criticises Kibaki, it should also criticise Raila, and when it criticises Uhuru, it must also criticise Kalonzo Musyoka. As the saying goes, media must not have some of the stomach and others of the back.', 'Here we need to understand that according to democracy, the job of criticising leaders, exposing their weakness and mistakes to avoid their recurrence, belongs to media as its way of protecting people from leaders who are inclined to oppression and other evils just because they have the power to oppress. Indeed, media should be regarded as enemies of society if they should shy to criticise leaders out of love or fear.', 'In its criticism of leaders or its education of people, there are certain things a radio may not do deliberately.', 'First, where it criticises all human deities, it may not criticise God.', 'Second, criticising a radio station will ensure it does so with responsibility, making sure it puts public interests and truth before everything else. ', 'Equally, when a radio station criticises a leader, it must ensure it does not violate his rights. It must also give a right of reply to all those who think they have been criticised unfairly. Criticism of a radio must also go along with readiness to give credit where due.', 'It must also be understood that to criticise deeds, policies, utterances and works of a leader does not amount to attacking the person. Unfortunately many dont understand this.', 'A leader who is above criticism is a dictator and people who protect such leaders from criticism aid and abet dictatorship even when they are its victims.', 'Unfortunately, dictatorship has a tendency to keep people as slaves who dont know of their rights and spend all their time defending dictators who the primary source of their problems.', 'Worse, when tyranny is constructed, common people forget about their interests. They only think of the interests of their leader. And for fear of dictatorship, poor people never dare utter a word about their problems. When the leader catches a cold, they sneeze.', 'During elections, poor people have no agenda. To them, the agenda of leaders is the agenda of elections. In fact it saddens that when people talk during elections, they hardly mention problems they want solved after elections.', 'Ultimately the freedom of expression is the freedom to criticize leaders and government. When people surrender this freedom, they deny themselves democracy and commit suicide. But a society without a voice is a slave society that must be liberated. This is the plight of Kenya today.', '\n']"

He has warned that rival political parties have infiltrated ODM strong zones to scuttle Prime Minister Raila Odingas presidential bid. Orengo asked voters to be wary of newly-formed parties especially in Nyanza purporting to support Raila yet they are ""agents of doom"".', ""Wary of Oduols immense influence in Siaya county, Orengo said a Raila government requires trusted lieutenants not gullible leaders who will be swayed by money to betray its course.

However, in the very same breath, the PM also endorsed an assistant minister in his office, Alfred Khangati, for governor of Bungoma, an ODM candidate.', ' ', 'The Khangati endorsement was instantly and widely viewed as a slap in the face and a kick in the teeth for Wetangula, given the fact that Ford Kenya has a very substantial candidate for governor of Bungoma in Ambassador Jack Tumwa. Where else will Wetangula, Ford-K and ourselves get a governor if the PM imposes Khangati? is a lament that has been heard throughout Bungoma and its diasporas, both inside and outside Kenya, since then.', ' ', 'Reports this week to the effect that Khangati has actually quit the race, citing lack of funding, and communicated this momentous decision to the PM by SMS and by letter to the IEBC returning officer in Bungoma, were instantly taken by the electorate to be insufficient to remove the disrespect to Wetangula occasioned by the initial endorsement at Kakamega. The mood on the ground is that the PM should revisit the region and acknowledge Tumwas bid.', ' ', 'In Ukambani in late December, the PMs wife, Ida Anyango Odinga, endorsed the assistant minister in charge of Youth Affairs in the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Wavinya Ndeti, for governor of Machakos county.

It was a message to the people of the land of his forefathers, a country from which he is only one generation removed.', 'But the most significant aspect of the message to Kenya is the impression that, this time, the world is really watching, is all eyes and ears, monitoring every step of the way towards Kenyas next presidential polls, the first since the disputed results of the 2007 poll that led straightaway to the post-election violence in which 1,300 died, 650,000 were displaced and the economy almost went into a tailspin, falling from an impressive 7% growth to below 4%.', 'Kenyans have held a national electoral event after the trauma of the PEV, the National Referendum on the new Constitution in August 2010, which went off without a hitch and to world-class standards rarely witnessed in Africa.', ' But a national plebiscite, with its starkly simple Black and White, Yes and No choice, is a much less complex affair than the forthcoming biggest and most complicated General Election of them all, an event that is likely to generate all manner of disputes and counter-claims.', 'As for dispute resolution, Obama advised Kenyans, Kenya must reject intimidation and violence, and allow a free and fair vote. Kenyans must resolve disputes in the courts, not in the streets.', 'The kind of scrutiny that the Obama Administration is bringing to bear on the Kenyan General Election is unprecedented and the top members of the political class and their strategists, whether outgoing or incoming, educated in America or not, will be forgiven for feeling more self-conscious than usual.', 'For millions of Kenyans, particularly prospective voters in the hotspots of 2007, this is no bad thing. In fact, the message should also have been broadcast on radio in its entirety, given the fact that the vast majority of Kenyans outside the ruling and middle classes and the far-flung Diaspora are not users of YouTube, but they do listen to FM radio keenly and broadcasting has a 24/7 cycle inside Kenya, including in Kiswahili and a large variety of the 42 vernacular languages and their dialects.', 'The US Presidents gesture places Kenya very high up on the list of his second-term foreign policy priorities.

Democracy must also mean the right to clean water, the right to shelter, the right to human security and the protection of human dignity and the human being. For me democracy is much broader, he adds.', 'However, Hassan says that with the reintroduction of multi-party politics and with its new constitution Kenya is now in its third phase  fighting for social justice, equity and developing an immature democracy. ', 'He believes the current struggle is best waged from within the establishment. You cannot achieve change in isolation. Ive said that Im not going to be a spectator; Im going to be an active participant in the struggle for change in my community and country. And Im satisfied to an extent that in the short period Ive been in parliament, Ive been able to do that, he says.', 'Even his political rivals agree that Hassan has positively changed Kamukunji during his brief time in Parliament. Hassan himself cites the bursaries he handed out to 3,500 deprived children of Kamukunji as his proudest achievement as MP. ', 'He is also credited with the 21 roads that have been built in the area during this period. Some of these roads link up to the city centre and have already contributed much in improving commerce in the bustling neighbourhood. Thus Eastleighs commercial hub now sees thousands of visitors daily, a feat that was previously impossible due to lack of access.', 'Regeneration', 'Business revival and the regeneration of Kamukunji as a whole is a singular achievement also noted by Hassan. He mentions the rejuvenation of Kamukunjis Kikomba market, the second largest second hand clothing market in Eastern and Central Africa, as well as the Burma meat market in Shauri Moyo which the government had shut down last May citing its unhygienic conditions.', 'All these places are seeing regeneration. Were doing quite a lot of rebuilding and reconstruction. Im confident that if Im given more time [as an MP], well be able to  brick by brick  build the whole of Kamukunji, so that well have a cleaner, healthier, safer and better Kamukunji, he says.', 'Improvements have also been made to the sanitation and health of Kamukunjis residents. Whereas previously sewage systems in the areas slums were non-existent or blocked, significant rejuvenation of the sewage networks have reduced urban environmental diseases that are unique to third-world cities like Nairobi.', 'The electrification of Kamukunji is another of Hassans achievement. Before his election as an MP certain parts of Eastland were in complete darkness.', ' These areas are now lit with security lights and street lights, improving safety levels and increasing trading at night. Despite being a victim of an assassination attempt and the numerous bomb explosions in Eastleigh, Hassan surprisingly looks as effervescent as ever. He credits the Kenyan people for his buoyancy and confidence.', 'The majority of Kenyans are hardworking, upright, in want of good leadership and a prosperous country that is moving forward and theyre willing to work across ethnic and religious lines. I think my optimism is built on that particular group of people of Kenyans who will move in the right direction when this country needs to change, he says.', 'The escalating violence in Tana River, along with the ongoing conflicts in Baragoi and North Eastern Kenya bring back sour memories to Hassan.', ' War scarred his fondest childhood memories. An ethnic Somali born in Nairobi to an itinerant trader father, Hassan recounts his travel to Garissa as a boy to learn Quran. Living in Tana River he found himself among a rich diversity of plants and wildlife, including elephants, hyenas, lions and crocodiles.', 'We spent a lot of time poking fun and throwing stones at the crocodiles, particularly when they came out into the sun; it was almost like they were tourists coming out to soak the sun. We had a lot of fun playing around with them during the periods that we were out of school. That was one of the earliest memories that I have of who I am and being at peace with the natural habitat, he says.', 'Shifta war', 'The so-called Shifta War of 1963 to 1967 in North Eastern Kenya and Garissa in particular sadly cut short the halcyon days of his childhood. ', 'Instead, his idyllic experience was quickly followed by his most harrowing early memory. This was a very tragic time in the history of our community. ', 'Thousands of our people were killed, thousands were injured and thousands of others were displaced as refugees both internally and in the neighbouring countries. That is probably the most traumatising and tragic memory that I have. I lost many of my beloved relatives, sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunties, and there are some who we do not even know if theyre still alive or not because theyve fled the conflict and have not returned, Hassan says.', 'The experience, he says, later made him empathise with the displaced people of the Rift Valley. But he accuses the current Kenyan government and its predecessors of failing to address the countrys previous wars. ', 'The issues of many of the victims of the Mau Mau struggle and many of the victims of the Shifta War have not been resolved. There have been no post-mortems and there has been no attempt to empathise with the people who have suffered horrendously during these cruel, terrible wars in our country, he says.', 'Kamukunji residents turned up in their thousands during the TNA party elections to vote for Hassan as their parliamentary candidate while he lay in his hospital bed recovering from grenade attack injuries', '. Im thankful to the people of Kamukunji for showing me their humanity. Ive received thousands and thousands of messages of solidarity wishing me well. ', 'I have been touched by the feelings of these thousands of Kenyans of different ethnic groups, different religious groups and different backgrounds. They have really given me a lot of courage and energy.', 'He is confident that on March 4,they will return him to Parliament with an overwhelming majority of votes as they did in the previous poll.', '\n']"

', ' The report says since last year, 477 Kenyans have lost their lives in inter-communal clashes in various parts of the country. Another 118,000 people have been displaced. ', ' The common theme, however, is the unwillingness of the government and other state authorities since the post-election violence of 2007-2008 to address the root causes of violence, reform the police, tackle official corruption, disband criminal groups, resettle displaced persons and hold accountable the many perpetrators of violence, it says.

In North Eastern, security forces have stoked tensions by using excessive force against local residents, especially after attacks by armed groups on the police and military.

', ' The Kenyan commission of inquiry that examined the 2007-2008 violence identified the conduct of the police as a fundamental problem, and since then little has changed, the report notes.', ' ', ' As a pointer to police ineptitude, the report says since August of last year, around 180 people have been killed in fighting between the agriculturalist Pokomo and the pastoralist Orma communities with little help coming from the police. ', ' Further, the possibility of violence has been exacerbated by increased struggle for power in the new devolved governance structure. ', ' In the Rift Valley, the report says no proper reconciliation ever took place. To the contrary, the report says the government adopted policies like skewed resettlement have widened the divide. ', ' The report makes a case study of the Kisumu vigilantes whom it identifies as American Marine Prime Minister Raila Odinga and China Group supporting Jubilee leaders Uhuru and Ruto. It says clashes occurred between the two groups last September after Uhuru visited Kisumu and police failed to intervene.

The report calls on Kenyan leadership, African Union and foreign governments to close ranks and undertake resolute actions to make sure the March elections are free of violence.

It featured the man known as the richest Black South African, Patrice Motsepe."", ""Motsepe, who is recognised by the Forbes Rich List as one of Africa's wealthiest people, announced on Wednesday, January 30 that he would be donating half of his estimated R20bn (Sh194,206,000,000) to improve the lives of the poor especially in the fields of education and health."", "" According to his Wikipedia profile, Motsepe was born in 1962 to a schoolteacher turned small businessman who owned a Spaza shop, the South African equivalent of a Kenyan tea kiosk, in Soweto that was popular with black mine workers. So it is not like he was born with the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth. The profile writer says it was from exposure from his father's kiosk that Motsepe learnt basic business principles and received firsthand exposure to mining."", "" A lawyer by training, Motsepe became the first black partner in the prestigious law firm Bowman Gilfillan in 1994 and specialised in mining and business law at a time when the new government had begun the process of promoting black empowerment and entrepreneurship. The SA government's black economic empowerment policy mandates that mining companies be at least 26 per cent black-owned."", ' Eventually by 1997 Motsepe set up a firm to begin buying the operating mines that would become the source of his wealth.', ""Motsepe's great act of generosity should put the spotlight on other wealthy Africans and I am hoping that In Kenya, wealthy people other than the nation's best known philanthropist, Manu Chandaria, will take the hint."", "" I still for instance cannot believe that there are still internally displaced people whose circumstances have not changed much since the abortion that passed for a general election in December 2007.

After all, you can't take it with you when you die."", "" The second cash money story that grabbed my attention was that of Helen Zille, the leader of South Africa's main opposition party who was shoved into the spotlight after a spat with one of the country's most politically connected business families, the Guptas. The Gupta family of South Africa are the majority shareholders of a SA national daily, The New Age newspaper. The Guptas are also widely said to be benefactors of the ruling ANC and are known to have strong ties with President Jacob Zuma."", ' The newspaper, in conjunction with the state broadcaster and a number of parastatals are involved with the live TV broadcast of a regular breakfast briefing that gets leading government figures including President Zuma and politicians such as Mrs Zille to attend and answer questions from a ticket buying public as well as the breakfast TV audience.', "" Recently Zille and her party withdrew from the breakfasts claiming they were sponsored by state-owned enterprises and this 'misuse of public funds' was of benefit to the Gupta family through their newspaper. Zille claimed that she and her party colleagues had only spoken at the breakfast under the assumption that it was funded by The New Age and members of the public who had bought tickets to attend."", ' Immediately after Zille and Co. withdrew sections of the media came out with stories saying that Zille was being economical with the truth and quoting unnamed sources who claimed that Zille had gone to the Gupta family estate in Saxonwold, Johannesburg, in 2011 to ask for a donation and that she had left with a substantial cheque.', "" Zille denied the accusations but eventually had to admit to receiving money from a Gupta employee 'in his personal capacity.' My thoughts were immediately cast back to the case of Kenya's Goldenberg scam and it's chief architect Kamlesh Pattni who once famously produced a damning list of politicians, journalists and others who had received cash from him.

', ' ', 'Raila is the leader of two political formations  the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and the Coalition for Reform and Democracy (CORD) and is seeking the presidency for a third time in a decade-and-a-half at the March 4 General Election. ', ' ', 'Similarly, Uhuru heads up two massive formations, The National Alliance (TNA) and the Jubilee Coalition, and is seeking the presidency for the second time in a decade. ', ' ', 'These two are the sons, respectively, of Kenyas founding Vice President, the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, and the founding President, Kenyatta. The rivalry between the two men is the culmination of one of the longest political feuds of Kenyan politics, the fallout in the mid-1960s between their fathers which has now crossed a number of generations.', ' ', 'The Kenyattas are among Kenyas largest landowners of all races and nationalities, with their assets having been acquired during Jomo Kenyattas 18 months as the first Prime Minister of Kenya (June 1, 1963, to December 11, 1964) and 14 years as founder-President (December 12, 1964, to August 22, 1978).', ' ', 'The Odingas are also among the wealthiest Kenyans, with assets denominated in the billions of shillings, but clearly not in the Kenyattas class, which defines Old Money in this countrys African population. There are Europeans and Asians in Kenya who are quietly seriously wealthy and multiple millionaires even in the worlds hardest hard currencies, which makes them multiple shilling billionaires, some of whom are landowners on a scale to rival the Kenyattas, but they remain well under the political, or indeed any other, radar, except the taxmans.', ' ', 'Who Let the Dog-whistle Politics Out?', ' ', 'However, the Odingas have long cultivated a populist brand of politics, even veering far leftwards towards Marxism-Leninist rhetoric at the height of the Cold War, when Odinga Snr was a frequent and honoured guest in the chancelleries and capitals of the then Soviet Union and China.

', ' ', 'But it is the land issue, for more than 100 years the most delicate and explosive issue in Kenya, that Raila has seized on and woven a dog-whistle politics narrative around it like none other since Jomo Kenyatta himself was denouncing the Mau Mau and they were claiming him for themselves as godhead and fountainhead in the 1950s.', ' Raila is travelling the length and breadth of Kenya on the campaign trail with one key message  that the Kenyattas own too much land for Uhuru to be a real reformist or to take Kenya to the next level of reforms, the full implementation of the Constitution of Kenya 2010.', ' For a nation of peasants and slum dwellers, and some of the worst income inequality indices in the world, this is a potentially incendiary message. However, Railas true audience, his real dog-whistle politics target subgroup, are the Rift Valley grassroots of Uhurus running mate Ruto. ', 'Uhuru pulled off the political coup of 2012 when he got Ruto to join him in the Jubilee Coalition. It was a stunning move and it generated the biggest realignment of political forces in a decade, since Raila himself led the exodus from then ruling party Kanu in October 2002 to form the National Rainbow Coalition (Narc) and scuttle President Daniel arap Mois succession agenda, which had Uhuru as its centerpiece. ', ' ', 'Uhurus move was based on such a radical proposal, an electoral union of the vast Mt. Kenya region and the Rift Valley vote blocs, that Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka of the Wiper Democratic Movement (WDM) ran all the way into a political union with Raila in CORD.', ' ', 'As we have often noted in these columns, the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin have never voted together in a presidential poll or a national referendum. However, the Kalenjin voted wholeheartedly for Uhuru in the 2002 race at President Mois urging but the rest of the country went for Mwai Kibaki as Third President of Kenya, overwhelming the Kanu ticket. ', ' ', ' ', 'At the core of the Land Question in Kenya is Kikuyu settlement in the Rift Valley. The political violence, both pre- and post-polls, of the multiparty era that begun in 1992, with the exception of the presidential transition poll of 2002, has had Rift Valley and the Kikuyu-Kalenjin divide as its focal point. The feat Uhuru and Ruto achieved in coming together ahead of only the second presidential transition poll in Kenyan history (and the first one with a runoff option) is the promise of erasing the Kikuyu-Kalenjin divide.', ' ', 'It is very specifically aimed at the Kalenjin in their Rift Valley redoubt. Raila is cleverly contriving to remind the Kalenjin that Rift Valley land was acquired on a massive scale by Kenyas biggest and therefore most land-hungry community  the Kikuyu  at a time when the regions most senior politician, Daniel Moi, was Vice President of the Republic. ', ' ', 'And though the Kalenjin then had no numbers imposing land hunger on them, their population has since exploded. Railas intention is to downgrade and degrade Rutos value to the Uhuru presidential campaign by reminding the Kalenjin that another Kikuyu President, a Kenyatta, imposed his terrific will on another Kalenjin deputy president, Moi, and if Jubilee takes State House history is likely to repeat itself. ', ' ', 'But only the Rift Valley audience hears this narrative, hence the dog-whistle paradigm. And that is exactly what Raila intends  that the Kalenjin Rift Valley audience hears him.', ' ', 'In Central Kenya, Railas dog-whistling on land issues is perceived quite differently. There, it is detonating all manner of conspiracies theories, including very dark suspicions indeed that Raila has a land redistribution agenda up his sleeve. ', 'This is a dreadful prospect for well-to-do Mt. Kenyans and an intriguing one for the millions of landless. The Kikuyu FM stations are full of speculative talk all the way into the wee hours of Railas real portent in harassing Uhuru so relentlessly on the land issue.', ' Caller after caller says Raila will change the Constitution to factor in land-grabs and redistribution as a way of addressing historical injustices; will therefore destabilize Kenya Big Time; will keep the Mt. Kenyans tied up in endless litigation over land issues; will make the Rift Valley, now pacified after such hard work by Uhuru and Ruto, once again a dangerous place.', ' ', 'Early in the week, Inspector General of Police David Kimaiyo issued a security advisory urging politicians not to revisit contentious land issues on the campaign trail. ', ' ', 'Responding directly to Kimaiyo in a campaign speech at Migori in his Luo Nyanza political backyard, Raila declared: The police cannot prescribe what we should or should not discuss.The directive also negates free speech, which is guaranteed in the Constitution.', 'This spectacle generated a shiver up and down Mt. Kenya and social media and the FM stations, including online, with Diaspora Mt. Kenyans, also commenting. ', ' ', 'Kimaiyo is not just another senior police officer in Railas perspective. He was his security consultant during the ill-fated 2007 presidential campaign; his candidature for the top Kenya Police Service position was a very special one indeed as he maintains the most cordial relations with Ruto and Uhuru on top of receiving the PMs own endorsement; and he hails from the Rift Valley, the nations epicenter of controversial land issues. Raila was instrumental, too, in the appointment of the Chief Justice and President of the Supreme Court of Kenya, Dr. Willy Mutunga, a one-time fellow political detainee and exile.  ', ' ', 'There has not been a top cop in Kenya of Kimaiyos political fault-line-bridging credentials since the late James Kanyotu, Kenyas longest-serving national spymaster. For Raila to treat him so brusquely so promptly on the issue of the Land Question is a signal being interpreted in Mt. Kenya as a sure-fire indication of the strength of the PMs near-future intentions for a radical rethink of land policy in Kenya.', ' ', 'Such a rethink has long been dreaded by the landed Mt. Kenya elite, owners of the nations choicest agricultural land and real estate. The real estate boom of the Kibaki era has signaled the arrival of Kenyas biggest and richest middle class yet  and it is still overwhelmingly Central Kenyan.  ', ' ', 'Also joining in the fray were Government Spokesman Muthui Kariuki and National Integration and Cohesion Commission Chairman Mzalendo Kivunjia, both of whom asserted that controversial land ownership issues belong to forums other than emotive political rallies, for instance the courts and other arbitration channels. Kariuki spoke of discussing land issues at political rallies as a powder keg and called it potentially lethal.', ' ', 'Raila and Kalonzo strenuously disagreed with Kimaiyo, Kariuki and Kivunjia. The VP, a lawyer, said he had reviewed the top cops advisory and it amounted to gagging the political class and Kenyans generally on a burning issue of national interest.', ' ', 'Is Railas dog-whistling strategy on land issues a vote winner? His treatment of IG Kimaiyos pioneering security advisory for campaigning politicians would seem to indicate that the strategy is too important for him to amend, let alone drop.', ' This can only mean there must be some indications on the ground of some success, or likely success, for Raila to hold on with such tenacity to the dog whistle on the land issue.', '\n']"

Contrary to Uhuru's and Rutos efforts to make the crimes against humanity they face look as though they are no big deal, they, in fact, are more than a big deal."", 'The truth is in Uhurus case. His political career is over notwithstanding the ICC outcome simply because of the seriousness of the charges.', 'This is not just making a statement for the sake of it. It is an informed statement based on what happens to individuals who get charged with serious crimes like the ones Uhuru faces. ', 'To be sure, there are not many individuals who face crimes against humanity but, the many examples we knoweven of a lesser gravity in seriousness, tell us Uhuru is done.  Take the example of OJ Simpson.', 'OJ or the Juice, as he was popularly known at his peak, was a star US professional football player like none seen before his time. He was the first professional football player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season, a mark he set in 1973, which was quite a feat considering no other player had ever racked up such yards in a 14-game season. ', 'He also holds the record for single season yards-per-game average, all of which earned him selection to the Professional Football Hall of Fame.', 'Following his retirement from professional football, OJ went on to become a sportscaster and actor and the sky appeared to be the only limit until the murder of his girlfriend in 1995 and one other person for which OJ was arrested and charged. ', 'Although he was acquitted of the murders after a lengthy trial that attracted a global following, in 1997, a civil court awarded a judgment against Simpson for their wrongful deaths.', ""The arrest and being charged with the murders marked the end of OJ Simpson's glory days and in all other respects. To seal it all, OJ was again arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, and charged with numerous felonies, including armed robbery and kidnapping for which he was found guilty and sentenced to 33 years in prison, which he is still serving."", 'Why did OJ become a non-entity after being arrested and charged with the murders even though he was not found guilty? Because thats the nature of the charges he faced, namely, the cold-blooded murder of two people. People believed he committed the murders despite being acquitted.', 'This is exactly the same situation Uhuru finds himself in because most people will still believe he committed the crimes he is charged with even if he is acquitted. In essence, Uhuru being president with ICC over his head even as an acquitted indictee is a form of impunity; in fact impunity of the worst kind.', 'This is one of the many reasons Uhuru cannot be our president given the circumstances he finds himself in. First, as practical matter, were the duo to be elected, both will be absentee president and vice-president as they will be spending all their time at the Hague defending their cases.', 'Ruto has said they can use technology to run the country from the Hague but this is a joke and the fact that they even raise this as a possibility is the more reason why they should not be elected.', 'There is no going around the fact that its impractical to govern a country when one is defending himself in The Hague, which requires their physical presence during trial now estimated to run for two to three years.', 'Second, given this fact, one must assume that the two intend to abscond and not attend their trial, or if convicted, not to show up for punishment, which is no less criminal. In fact, absconding ICC trial is criminal under the Rome Statute and consequences for doing so are not only specific to the absconding suspects, they are even more importantly national in scope.', 'For example, were Uhuru and Ruto to abscond once elected, Kenya will be made a pariah state like Sudan. This means we can forget any gains we hope to get from full implementation of our constitution, which may not happen, anyway, with the two in power. ', 'One consequence of being labeled a pariah state is that Kenya will be subjected to economic sanctions and none of its officials will be given visas to travel to other countries, especially those that matter to our welfare.', 'If Kenya is cut from the world economic chain, that will be the end of our country. You have no idea what the consequences of such economic sanctions can be. ', 'Just the other day, Sweden banned the importation of miraa to that country, a decision which miraa exporter Dan Aritho says is certain to adversely impact the economy of Meru county.', 'One need not be an exporter like Aritho to understand the devastating impact of shutting the country from the world market. It goes without saying we shouldnt even entertain the thought of being slapped with sanctions of this nature.', 'Third, besides economic sanctions, the election of Uhuru and Ruto will most likely see the United States, European Union states, and others that support the ICC process shun us diplomatically.', 'Uhuru was quoted as saying recently Kenya does not need the West. This is simply another reason he should not be elected as president because he fails to understand the importance of maintaining our relations with the West. ', 'That being the case, the only thing this writer and many others see as Uhurus only option were he to salvage his political career, is to first step-aside from vying for the presidency and chart a path of redemption. That starts with forging a good working relationship with Raila.', ' Working with Raila makes sense because hes likely to be our next president and even if Uhuru were to give him a run for his money, hell ultimately fall short as he sees his friend being sworn in as president.', 'Indeed, the best thing Uhuru could do is simply step-aside and endorse Raila. There is nothing wrong in doing so other than entrenched old notions of political beliefs we must shake off from our body politic.', 'Stepping aside and endorsing Raila will bring with it immediate and long term benefits for Uhuru that wont exist were Uhuru to defy common sense and continue in his ill-advised quest for the presidency.', 'One such immediate benefit is that Uhuru would have elevated himself to a statesman by putting the interests of the country firstsomething very few politicians ever do in life. ', 'By elevating himself as such, he can then find ample time to defend his case at the Hague and notwithstanding the outcome, he will have a far larger constituency sympathetic to his situation, especially if hes convicted than he otherwise would.', 'The latter, coupled with a president in office willing to utilise state resources to bring these cases to an end consistent with national security interesta case Uhuru cannot make as president for the reason that most people oppose his candidacy because they believe and rightly so that Uhuru wants to use the presidency to defy the ICC process.', 'The irony of it is, this would be no different were Uhuru to endorse someone other than Raila as that will clearly be seen as a project designed to do just that, namely, thwarting or altogether defying the ICC process.', 'However, endorsing Raila will be different because it will first be one significant unifying event of the country that can only be furthered by Raila acting in the best interests of the country in seeking an end to the ICC process consistent with the rule of law and justice for the victims.

Why? Been there, done that. Kenyans have reached record highs of skepticism. We have officially been numbed to promises.', 'The Jubilee manifesto has a chapter aptly named, Land Reforms: A property owning democracy The content reads; ...Millions of Kenyans today have no property to call their own, yet remarkably, only 20% of Kenyas land is privately owned.', 'Public land is 13% of the land in the country with 67% being community land, which has been traditionally managed by local authorities, with communities who actually live on it having little benefit.

We find holes in them. There are multiple flaws in the Blueprints. On the one hand we will criticize the empty promises but demand that there be more, otherwise it just confirms to us that they were thought out at the last minute and strung together for the purposes of campaigns.

Should we brand him as one other step in the wrong direction similar to the Nancy Barasa saga in the reform trajectory? One hopes that this was a slip of the brain and an apology is being processed for quick delivery.', 'One mans story tells it all. Bildad Kaggia rejected 300 acres offered to him by Jomo Kenyatta.

Manchester United travelled to Goodison Park and lost. That result boosted the confidence of the Toffees and its probably one of the major reasons why Everton have done so well this season.

David Moyes has done a fine job this season and its no wonder teams like Chelsea have him under their radar. But the ever so annoying Manchester United havent lost a game in more than two months! Ouch! They have their sights set on the title and they dont intend to waver. This match-up is exciting at this point of the season given the great form of both sides.', '\n']"
