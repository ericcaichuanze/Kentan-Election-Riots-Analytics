After all, human knowledge is increasing. We can see this concretely in the development and declining costs of new medicines like HIV drugs, and in the creation of new seeds that allow poor farmers to be more productive. Once such tools are invented, they are never un-invented  they just improve.', 'Skeptics point out that we have a hard time delivering new tools to the people who need them. This is where innovation in the measurement of governmental and philanthropic performance is making a big difference. That process  setting clear goals, picking the right approach, and then measuring results to get feedback and refine the approach continually helps us to deliver tools and services to everybody who will benefit.', 'Innovation to reduce the delivery bottleneck is critical. Following the path of the steam engine long ago, progress is not doomed to be rare and erratic. We can, in fact, make it commonplace.', 'Though I am an optimist, I am not blind to the problems that we face, or to the challenges that we must overcome to accelerate progress in the next 15 years. The two that worry me the most are the possibility that we will be unable to raise the funds needed to pay for health and development projects, and that we will fail to align around clear goals to help the poorest.', 'The good news is that many developing countries have growing economies that allow them to devote more resources to helping their poorest people. India, for example, is becoming less dependent on aid, and eventually will not need it.', 'Some countries, like the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, and Australia, are increasing their foreign-aid budgets; others, even traditionally generous donors like Japan and the Netherlands, have reduced theirs. The direction of many countries, including the United States, France, Germany, and Canada, is unclear.', 'Still, aid is critical. It helps people in the poorest countries to meet their basic needs. It funds innovation in the creation of new tools and services, and in their delivery. Unfortunately, aid budgets are threatened by fiscal weakness in almost all of the advanced countries. Unless voters hear about the positive impact that their generosity is having, they will inevitably focus on issues closer to home.', 'A single story, true or not, about a small amount of aid being misused can often cloud the entire field. Imagine how you would feel about investing if every article you read were only about stocks that did poorly, with no reporting on the big successes.', 'Historically, aid was discussed largely in terms of the total amount of money invested. But now that we are measuring indicators like child mortality more precisely, people are able to see the impact that aid has in stark terms  that it means the difference between, say, giving people access to HIV treatment and letting them die. When framed this way, aid has a better chance of becoming a priority.', 'But will the world align around a clear set of goals in the next 15 years? The United Nations is starting to map out new goals for the years following the 2015 expiration of the current Millennium Development Goals. As with the MDGs, the next set of goals could help to align groups doing the work, remind voters what their generosity supports, and allow us to see where we are making progress in delivering solutions to the poor.', 'The MDGs success means that there is a lot of interest in expanding them to include a broader set of issues. But many of the potential new goals lack unanimous support, and adding a lot of new goals  or goals that are not easily measurable  may sap momentum.', 'The MDGs were coherent because they focused on helping the poorest people in the world. The groups that needed to work together to attain them were easy to identify, and they could be held accountable for cooperation and progress. When the UN reaches agreement on other important goals like mitigating climate change, it should consider whether a different set of actors and a separate process might be best for those efforts.', 'The progress that the world has made in helping the poorest in the last 15 years is the kind of good-news story that happens one life at a time, so it often does not have the same visibility as a big setback, such as the outbreak of a new epidemic. From time to time, we should step back and celebrate the achievements that come with having the right goals, the necessary political will, generous aid, and innovation in tools and their delivery. Doing so has certainly deepened my commitment to this work.', ' ', 'Bill Gates is Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. ', '\n']"

It was the day the nations Chief Justice revealed that there have been threats to his life and those of other judges.', 'Details of these threats apparently came from the outlawed murderous Mungiki sect that had terrorized Central Province for the better part of the last decade.', 'The same sect was adversely mentioned in the 2008 Rift Valley retaliatory massacres following the disputed elections that saw 1500 Kenyans slaughtered in various parts of Kenya. ', 'At that time, at least by the ICC reports, Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were alleged to have organized for them a meeting at State House to plan the Rift Valley retaliatory attacks in Naivasha, Gilgil, Molo, Nakuru and Eldoret. Uhuru Kenyatta, President Kibaki and Francis Muthaura denied these allegations.', 'Now, five years later, the same Mungiki have come to the defense of Uhuru and William Rutos candidacy. The threat was made on the eve of the judgment that contested the duos integrity to seek public office.', 'If it is true that this poisoned letter pen sent to CJ Mutunga came from the Mungiki sect, what connection is there between Jubilee Alliance and the outlawed sect? If these goons can dare to threaten the CJs life together with his other members of the bench; who then is safe in Kenya?', 'As the Chief Justice was revealing a threat to his life, something else more ominous came to light. Francis Kimemia the Head of the Civil Service had the audacity to instruct a junior immigration official to block the Chief Justice from travelling to Tanzania for a one day meeting.', 'This affront to the CJ baffled many Kenyans. The audacity with which the Head o f the Civil Service chose to embarrass the CJ was mind boggling. First, the Kenyan constitution is very clear about the separation of powers among the three arms of government.', 'The Chief Justice heads one such arm and enjoys independence and autonomy just like the Speaker of the National Assembly. In real terms the CJ and the Speaker are at the same level as the President and therefore the Head of the Civil Service has no business running the CJs schedule- something that even the President cannot do. In more practical terms Francis Kimemia is the CJs junior twice over.', 'These dangerous developments may force Kenyans to revisit the recent judgment that cleared Uhuru Kenyatta and William Ruto to run for president even though they are facing charges of crimes against humanity.', 'Had the judges been intimidated? How come the bench that declared that the case was not in their jurisdiction and that it was only the Supreme Court that could hear the case ended up hearing it anyway, passing judgment and even awarding costs to the respondents? Are Kenyans on a wild goose chase to speculate foul play during the trial?', 'These dangerous developments come at a time when the CORD coalition has accused the Head of the Civil Service together with the military and NIS heads as having met recently to plan how to rig elections in favour of Jubilee Alliance. Is it possible that there plans afoot to rig elections using civil servants to cause chaos again in Kenya?', 'It is a good thing that Francis Kimemia came out to clarify the issue and even sent a circular to all civil servants asking them to desist from engaging in political campaigns. Was that circular genuine or was it a mere tactical retreat as more clandestine plans were in the offing?', 'Those who are planning to kill the CJ and rig the elections cannot be called Kenyans or friends of Kenya. Their memories must be really short if indeed they have forgotten the mayhem of 2008 that ruined our economy and loss of property and innocent lives. It beats logic that as we prepare for the next elections since 2007 with ICC cases in the offing, someone can plan an explosive situation like eliminating the CJ and a number of his judges.', 'These planned criminal activities must be a test case for the New Inspector General, the Director of Investigations and the Director of Public Prosecutions.', 'If they dont take decisive action, Kenyans will be forgiven for assuming that they too are part of the conspiracy.', 'The only way Francis Kimemia and his boys can get out of this mess is to order a thorough and conclusive investigation to bring the Mungiki commanders, their sympathizers and sponsors to take responsibility and face the law.', 'Like I have said elsewhere on these pages before; chaos in Kenya are a recipe for turmoil in East Africa. We cannot allow this to happen so soon after the disaster of 2008.', ' ', '\n']"

', 'On Monday, February 18, 2013, as I was sitting in the Judicial Service Commission interviews for the recruitment of the Deputy Chief Justice, my office received a poison- pen letter from the Mungiki Veterans Group/Kenya Sovereignty Defence Squad.

This constitution must be protected and guarded jealously. Threats and intimidation of this nature against the Chief Justice, judges, or any other Kenyan or individual must be resisted actively, and rejected resolutely. I have given most of my life to a better Kenya and if taking it is what will be required to consolidate and secure our democratic gains in this election, or even thereafter, that is a price I am not afraid to pay.', '2. I have invested heavily in the past one and a half years in creating a new Judiciary. I have repeatedly given my pledge to the country that the Judiciary will not flinch in interpreting the constitution as is required, a task we have executed very well. For the 2013 general election, we have done sufficient ground work to handle both pre and post-election matters in accordance with the law. On February 28, 2013, we shall hold a special session with all judges of the High Court to give Kenyans a final statement on our preparedness. Therefore, candidates or their supporters  real or claimed  should not panic. We shall decide all cases independently, and with scrupulous fidelity to the constitution and the law. Let no individual, group, candidate, or supporter imagine that cowardly and darkly acts such as these will cower us. We have seen and overcome worse, and we will all soldier on for this country. None will be held hostage by a cabal of retrogrades. ', '3. The Judiciary has, in a private correspondence, communicated to Mr Kimemia as to the legal position on the matter of the small hiccup to ensure it never occurs again. ', '4. I believe that Kenyan security agencies, unless they willfully neglect or refuse to, have the capacity and resources to investigate the sources and partnerships of this threatening letter. To this end, I have this morning sent the letter to the Inspector General of Police, the Director of the Criminal Investigations Department, Director of the National Intelligence Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions to investigate this matter and give the country a progress report. I am also asking the Inspector General of Police to take the necessary steps to enhance the security of judges and other judicial officers at this time. ', '5. If anybody, any candidate, any party, any agency, or any other actor thinks that it will bend the ear, mind and resolve of this Chief Justice to do anything that is unconstitutional or illegal, then they are mistaken. On any matter that will come before me or the Supreme Court, I and the Court shall operate strictly within the confines of the constitution. Intimidation and threats are uninvited guests and will not be hosted in the execution of our mandate. ', '6. The political class must choose whether, either through direct pronouncements or suggestive behaviour, they want a peaceful, democratic and fair election free from the ring of rigging and intimidation, or whether they want to put the country on a path of violence. Whatever choice the political class and leadership makes, they must remain aware that ultimately, the people of Kenya and the rule of law will triumph. The Judiciary is playing its part in protecting and upholding the constitution; let Kenyans also do their part. ', '7. I appeal to Kenyans to hold a peaceful election. It is only by so doing that we shall silence these dark forces of retrogression and also advance our constitutional and democratic promise. My fellow Kenyans, with confidence and tribute to the nation, go and vote for our Constitution. It is the only way to reject those who threaten and proclaim violence as a false choice.
