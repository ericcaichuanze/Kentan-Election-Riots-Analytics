They remained fictitious up until my young and quite impressionable cousin started pointing out to me the signs and symbols of the Illuminati in every music video we happened to be watching together. ', 'Reluctant as I was to believe in the existence of the Illuminati, I began noticing certain patterns  the repetitions and similarities in every music video. For instance, the triangular, diamond-like shape seen often when these celebrities touch the index fingers and thumbs of both hands together. This shape is also seen a special effect in other videos packaged as entertainment for the masses. It is speculated that this is the sign of the womb where life begins while others claim it is the sign of the pyramid as seen on the US dollar bill and as such those who make this symbol are staking their claim and control over world resources.', ""As far-fetched as it all sounds, Dr Justin Adiyb's book offers even more alarming statements on the Illuminati, Freemasons and other such organisations. Sample the following statement as extracted from the book: The Jesuit priests are blood-thirsty, power-hungry satanists whose only interests is money and power... they were the force behind the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.. they have destroyed nations, started wars and murdered rulers and presidents. And yet another statement: Note for all Muslims: The Koran that you hold in your hands today is not the original Koran."", ""Illuminati is real, Adiyb says. They have infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Take the visa card for example. VI is Roman for six. The letter 'S' is sigma for six while 'A' is the ancient Babylonian symbol for six. Put together it (Visa) translates to 666."", ""Adiyb further adds that smart cards, used to buy goods here in Kenya and elsewhere, are another method employed by the Illuminati in their quest to control the planet. Incidentally, yet another symbol of the Illuminati is the 'seeing eye' also prominent on the dollar bill at the apex of a pyramid. According to Adiyb, the implication of this can be summed up in four words:"", 'Big brother is watching - watching and seeing everything all the time. The seeing eye is also the symbol of deity, some believe it is the eye of God but some believe it is the eye of Lucifer  the all seeing god of the universe On the other hand, the five pointed star is a symbol of Satan.', 'Apparently, a great number of the members of the Order of the Illuminati come through Freemasonry. The head of the Illuminati at the present time are the Rothchilds  a powerful family with unlimited resources ranging in the trillions. ', 'Directly under them is the Council of 13, also known as the Grand Druid Council. Directly under is the Council of 33 - these are the highest Freemasons in the world, and under them is the Council of 500  the richest people in the world often listed in the Forbes 500 list.', ' Jay Z, Beyonce, Rihanna are not among the 500 richest people in the world but they are the lesser luminaries who contribute to the chaos of the Illuminati, says Adiyb of some of the performing artistes suspected to be part of the Illuminati. The higher hierarchies of the Illuminati use these lesser luminaries who are very influential to spread and infiltrate into every aspect our lives.', 'Still according to Adiyb, in the US, the Illuminati are now in the process of destroying stored food and farmlands. Thus, the only food that will be available will be in Federal Houses and people will therefore have to depend on the Federal Government for everything. In Africa, the Illuminati have allegedly brought in Monsanto  the world leading manufacturer of genetically modified seeds and companion pesticide.', ""Monsanto seeds are genetically modified and are designed to contaminated all other normal crops in your field, writes Adiyb in his book. This means that once your field is contaminated you will not be able to grow normal seeds, only Monsanto seeds will grow. Monsanto are part of the Illuminati plan to control the world's food supply."", 'Monsanto maize was been banned in France and was later overturned by EU on the basis that there was no scientific evidence on its inviability. Thus if Monsanto were to be adapted in Africa, Adiyb says it will be part of the greater Illuminati plan to control world affairs through governments and corporations for the purpose of establishing a new world order.', 'Movie producers are the lesser luminaries contributing to the chaos. Adiyb asserts that the movie industry is a part of the Illuminati plan. Phonetically the first three letters of cinema, C-I-N means Sin which is exactly what is encouraged in movies.', 'Indeed, a lot of the information in this book does sound far-fetched and aside from mentioning certain Kenyan artiste known to use some of the Illuminati symbols, the implications of Illuminati on East Africa is not clearly brought out. However, Adiyb promises a sequel where perhaps what is unclear in this book will be be made clear in the next.', 'The Illuminati and Freemasonry in East Africa is available in select bookshops at Sh1,300.', 'Stars: 3', '\n']"

It is a tribute, says the smiling chief executive of Safaricom, Kenyas biggest mobile phone network, to the fact his customers have no intention of switching provider.', 'When he stopped unlimited data use last year, he received offensive messages. Some customers bombarded him on Twitter; others set up hate websites. His decision was partly to limit the scope for hate speech ahead of the March 4 elections. For two weeks I was spawn of the devil, he says. Two years ago I would have been a little bit upset about it and taken it personally. But people have short memories  Ill move on and tomorrow Ill be a hero.', 'As head of Safaricom, which is 40 per cent owned by Vodafone of the UK, the 55-year-old leads a company seen as a national institution but that is often accused of monopolistic tendencies. Collymore uses the word dominant before correcting himself. Why dont we call it ubiquitous ... I think thats a nice word.', 'For the Guyana-born Collymore, this means he is a celebrity. They put this whole celebrity thing on me here ... you dont have a choice. I cant imagine many corporate leaders in any other part of the world  Richard Branson maybe  who are instantly recognised, he says.', 'The same was true for his predecessor, Michael Joseph, whom Collymore describes as a benevolent dictator. He says he was a little more inclusive but soon found himself adopting a similar approach. Michael and I are worryingly similar.', 'Safaricom has 19 million customers in a country of 40 million, which translates to nearly every adult. It reported revenues of Sh116.5 billion ($1.3 billion) last year and has developed an international reputation for innovation.', 'One reason is that for many Kenyans a mobile connection is much more than a telephone. It is also a substitute office and bank account, thanks to Safaricoms M-Pesa, a money transfer system named after the Swahili word for money that allows customers to send cash via text message. The service is used by 15 million customers to buy everything from sugar to flights, at an average 80 transactions a second. It is so successful that 31 per cent of Kenyas GDP washes through the system, and it has been exported to India and Qatar.', 'The companys latest initiative is M-Shwari, a savings and lending service. Theres Sh200 billion-Sh300 billion sitting in mattresses or locked boxes. At the moment, if your shack goes up in flames so does your money, he says of the appeal of interest-earning M-Shwari accounts.', 'His statement may be all too prescient. Five years ago, 100,000 homes were burnt or looted when disputed elections sent the country into a tailspin. Allegations of vote-rigging triggered violence that killed more than 1,300 people and displaced more than 600,000. Growth in east Africas biggest economy plummeted to an annual rate of 1.5 per cent from seven per cent a year earlier.', 'In the hope of avoiding a repeat of such chaos, Safaricom will for the first time relay results directly from polling stations to tallying centres, and is already sending out election education messages to some of the countrys 14 million registered voters. We are a huge part of democracy, says Collymore, who expects flare-ups but no 2008-style meltdown. It will be much tougher [to rig].', 'While his biggest nightmare is always the outage of M-Pesa, which slows when demand spikes, he worries the entire network may overload during the election. Weve got a plan of action ... we have to keep the country communicating ... and we have to keep money flowing, he says.', 'The greater risk for the country is a political deficit, and after the election he says he will focus on combating corruption. We have to get rid of corruption in Africa  Africa could be such a great investment destination if we can just deal with those issues, he says. Young people feel economically, politically, socially disempowered  and that is being vented in a few places but not vented in the places it should matter.', 'He points to events in the Middle East and north Africa as a potential harbinger of what could happen in Kenya. The thing that triggered the Arab spring was not political; it was social discontent. The gap between rich and poor here is growing ... and that, I think, presents us with a bigger challenge.', 'Collymore, who watches Kenyas evolving political scenarios as if he is a citizen himself, has made quick work of becoming a national champion, and regularly appeals to national sentiment despite his British-Guyanan background. Now I say, me Im Kenyan, me, he says, teasing out a typical turn of phrase. Many Kenyans seem to appreciate his efforts: he was awarded the Moran of the Burning Spear by the president last year  a prize rarely given to foreigners  was presented with a goat for his birthday and is often urged to get a piece of land in keeping with local tradition.', 'Collymores ability to adapt to new contexts was nurtured from an early age. He was raised by his grandparents in Guyana for 12 years and when he was 16 his mother, who had moved to the UK, brought him to join her in London. As the only black child in his class, he tried to be wallpaper to avoid getting beaten up. I didnt even know what the word wog was until I got there. I didnt know what racial abuse was, he says.', 'After school, he had to forgo a place at Warwick University because he was not eligible for funding. I wanted to go to university and I disliked not having gone and for some years after I wished Id gone, he says. Now it doesnt matter, [but] I would always advise a young person to go to the best university you can find.', 'When graduates ask for his advice, however, he preaches the value of being able to adapt, an attribute that has driven his own career. Unable to pursue a degree, Collymore spent his time filling forms as a junior underwriter and working as a train announcer while pursuing his passion for surrealist stuff.', 'Were it not for his mother, he might still be selling his oil paintings along the railings of Hyde Park. But she joked she would evict him unless he got a serious job and got him an interview at British Telecom, where she worked. He was given an entry-level job as a clerical officer.', 'His career took off when he joined the UKs Cellnet in 1993, just as the corporate world was starting to venture into mobile telephony. I was walking down a path no one else had walked and I thought, this is good because the rules arent written and Im just going to make the rules up as I go, he says. We took some risks. This change thing  it is actually quite exciting, its good, and you will make mistakes and you will stumble and fall and thats quite neat.', 'The hankering after new ground and love of adaptability has served him well.

Actually, Raila instituted a private prosecution that was predictably snuffed out by AG Amos Wako. During the debate Raila could have done himself real good by at least pointing to that private prosecution. One cannot understand why he just kept mum. Had the late Saitoti been a candidate, the matter would have been really politically embarrassing despite his having been exonerated by the High Court.', 'Uhuru did himself a lot of good to appear for the second debate for he would have had coward written all over himself. His opponents would have had a field day with the land mater, and he would not have been in a position to be able to directly rebut any brickbats that came his way. Perhaps his threat not to attend was just some ploy of sorts. Did his appearance at the debate help his image? It at least created the impression that he was not evading the limelight in some discomfiture. Uhuru in the end did not come out badly but neither was the matter resolved if you want to put it that way.', 'Will it now recede into the background? Probably not. He tried his best to explain his position through the willing buyer, willing seller line and that it has been dealt with via the declaration of wealth required of public officers. This is much like Mitt Romney declining to make public his annual tax returns save for two years. Uhuru did not dispel the impression that he and his family sit on immensely huge tracts of land acquired by proximity to power, specifically by his father having been the Head of State for 15 years. Is that illegal? May be not. Is it an issue politically and morally? Politically yes.', 'Morally it may depend on where you are, but that it is potent politically is indicated by reports that the Kenyatta family has ceded 4,000 acres in Taveta. And that is precisely the matter. If you can cede that much land, then how much do you own? How did you come to own 4,000 acres in Taveta? Who were the immediate previous owners? If these owners were departing colonial settlers should the land not have gone to Tavetans? How were other tracts of land acquired? This is the line of questioning that Martha Karua should have taken. As a very strong presidential contender, why was Uhuru largely quite about the delay in the appointment of the land commission?', 'Paul Muite did himself a lot of good by proposing that some leases of large tracts of land in the Rift Valley should not be renewed on the expiry of the 99 year period so that the pieces can be used to settle the landless in those areas.', 'Uhuru and Raila did not do themselves much good when it came out that feuds between the Finance and Lands ministries which are probably at the centre of some of the shortcomings in the resettlement of IDPs.', 'Dida touched on a raw nerve in Central Province, i.e the land that those perceived to have been members of or supporters of the Mau Mau lost to the so-called home guards and loyalists. The latter classes were no doubt quite close to Mzee Jomo Kenyatta. Raila was right, the betrayal of the aspirations of freedom fighters and other concomitant historical injustices cannot be blamed on Uhuru. The commission of the original sin, if at all, lies elsewhere.', 'Much as the Salaries and Remuneration Commission is a constitutional body that cannot be dictated to, it is not convincing for presidential candidates to be seeming to be leaving everything in regard to the salaries of state and public officers to the commission, especially when its recent proposals on the pay of state officers appear to be signalling business as usual.', 'Kibaki was a compromise candidate in 2002 not because he is gentle but because he was also the strongest among the people supporting him. Through the NAK he had managed to bring together no less than 12 political parties including his DP, FORD-Kenya, and NPK. The LDP brigade of Raila, Kalonzo, and Awori had no choice but to endorse him since the very act of departing Kanu and actually joining the opposition that they had hitherto scoffed at, had in a way weakened them.', 'You do not seek refuge in a neighbour s house and think that you can call the shots there. Kibaki had since his loss to Moi, having come in at a strong second remained steadfast as leader of the opposition while Raila had his NDP dissolved to join Kanu. Mudavadi who wants to paint himself as a Kibaki of sorts with a gentlemanly mien should pay attention to Kibakis bare knuckled campaign in 1997.', 'In the 2013 general election, it is Raila and not Mudavadi who is the compromise candidate, and it is precisely because he is stronger than Mudavadi, with the latter apparently being a very poor student of Kenyan political history despite having been in its midst for over two decades. Coincidentally, Raila is in 2013 a compromise candidate facing Uhuru as his strongest opponent just like KIbaki faced the latter as a compromise candidate in 2002. In contrast to the departure from Kanu by the LDP troop, Mudavadi vacated ODM almost alone. At least William Ruto left with his colleagues from North and Central Rift and beyond in tow. If Ruto and Uhuru were not willing to have the much stronger Kalonzo as their compromise candidate, how were they going to settle for Mudavadi? ', '\n']"
