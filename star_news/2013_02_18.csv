Elusive is more apposite an adjective.', '\n', 'Here is the\nstory. The report of the Independent Review Commission (IREC or the\nKriegler Commission) that reviewed the bungled 2007 polls had\ndescribed voter registration in Kenya as open to serious\ncriticism. Hence, after some delays related to the procurement of\nbiometric voter registration (BVR) kits, the Independent Elections\nand Boundaries Commission (IEBC) undertook to register voters afresh\nto cure this congenital infirmity suffered by the then extant voter\nregister. This commenced on November 19, 2012, targeted 18 million\nKenyans across about 25,000 registration centers and ended on\nDecember 18, 2012. At its close, the IEBC published that it had\nregistered 14,340,036 voters during the exercise.', '\n', 'The voter\nregisters were then opened for public inspection on January 14, 2013\nso that Kenyans could verify the accuracy of the data in the IEBC\nrecords. Following this verification exercise, the IEBC published a\ngazette notice on February 18, 2013 announcing the completion of the\ncompilation of the Principal Register. On February 24, 2013, details\nof the voter register (the Principal Register) were published on the\nIEBC website and recorded a figure of 14,352,545.', '\n', 'This represented\na growth of 12,509 voters between the closure of the voter\nregistration exercise and the end of the voter verification exercise.\nHow could these figures have increased while there were supposed to\nbe no more voters registered?', '\n', 'On March 2, 2013,\nthe IEBC published an additional list of 36,236 voters who were said\nnot to have had biometric information. Hence, on March 4, 2013\n(election-day) we had a Principal Register and the list of\nnon-biometric voters: both of which added up to 14,388,781. It was\nrevealed by some political parties that the IEBC had given them a\ndifferent version of the voter register to use on election-day. ', '\n', 'Yet, when the\nIEBC announced presidential election results on March 9, 2013, the\ntotal number of registered voters was 14,352,533. Surprisingly, this\nwas not even the sum of all registered voters per county as recorded\nin the same announcement. This came to 14,349,896. ', '\n', 'When questioned\nat the Supreme Court about what the exact voter registration figures\nwere, the IEBC submitted that the true and final voter register was\nnot the Principal Register (as provided for by law) but what was\nknown as the Green Book. It explained that the Green Book\nwas a hand-written list of registered voters recorded by its\nofficials at voter registration centers during the voter registration\nexercise (alternative or complimentary back-up perhaps?). It is\ncritical to note that the Green Book had not been previously\npublicly mentioned or afforded to the public for scrutiny or\nverification.', '\n', 'The Green\nBook comprised the Principal Register (14,352,545), the Special\nRegister (36,236) and 12 trainee registrations; in total 14,388,793.\nOn July 18, 2013, the IEBC would however announce that the total\nnumber of registered voters was 14,388,781. The 12 trainee\nregistrations had vanished!', '\n', 'The Green\nBook bears uncanny resemblance to the Black Book that was\ncreated in 1992 in preparation to the first multi-party elections. It\nis a hand-written collection of hundreds of individual notebooks\nlisting voters and was recommended for discontinuation by the\nKriegler report; in fact, the Kriegler report recommended that the\ndestruction of the Black Books should be seriously\nconsidered.', '\n', 'That there were\nclear discrepancies between the figures in the Green Book and\nthe results announced by the IEBC is indubitable. Equally bad was\nwhat were observed or construed as strategic changes in the voter\nregister:', '\n', '\nThe pattern of changes appears to have been strategic in nature. A\ncomparison of the numbers of registered voters per region in December\n2012 and February 2013 shows that Jubilee stronghold regions were\ninfused with a total of 68,148 additional voters while the Coalition\nfor Reform and Democracy (CORD) strongholds were stripped of 14,125\nvoters...', '\n', '\nOverall, the net result of the changes amounts to 48,745 voters added\nbetween December 2012, when the voter register was officially closed,\nand July 2013, when the final results were published. ', '\n', 'Despite the\nIEBCs multiple attempts to explain all these\ndiscrepancies/irregularities in the voter registration figures, there\nis still no way to resolve the various, different totals of\nregistered voters.', '\n', '\nThe point being made here is the following: as we continue to\nvigorously urge Kenyans to register as voters, equally urgent is to\nunequivocally clarify to all how this registration exercise will\ntranslate into a credible voter register that can withstand even\nrudimentary scrutiny; and will actually will be the only and\nexclusive register used in the 2017 elections.

Their voices are crucial to the political process. It matters to the people they employ and the politicians who come calling now, after the election and throughout the five-year term that they are in office. ', 'Their voices need to call us all to order. Those of us who use their (industry captains) instruments to spread ethnic hate and divide the organisations we work in, where we get our daily bread from and support our families and for the politicians who use the same to divide the nation, yet trumpet their lofty manifestos without thinking twice about where the money (read taxes) will come from to operate should they not save-guard the economy. People asking for 50 bob dont contribute to the taxes that power government  we do. ', 'In 2010 as we geared up to the referendum, two voices stood out for me. One was that of Michael Joseph who not only asked his staff to register and had the then IIEC set up registration desks at Safaricom HQ1, but he also took 10 minutes of his time to get onto the Big Breakfast and urge the rest of us and his peers to ensure we registered and took part in the referendum. ', 'The other voice that stood out was that of Dr James Mwangi who did pretty much the same thing. Today, Kenya Private Sector Alliance is at the forefront of ensuring we all reclaim our country with the Mkenya Daima initiative  however, I want more. How much more? Let me explain. ', ""Should business leaders be political? Let me rephrase  should business leaders be involved in politics? There is a difference, and it's not just a semantic one. As Kenyans who make big decisions that have big impact, leaders in business across the board have over the years developed a sort of allergy to the idea of a CEO getting into policy-shaping. And yet business leaders are finding themselves drawn into the political process  oddly enough, to try and depoliticise it. "", ""In 2012, in the lead up to the US presidential elections, Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz both expressed concerns about America's current level of partisanship, and what such ideological gridlock could do to the economy. How is that any different from what we are going through here in Kenya and the fact that tribal and divisive politics endangers how we work and function and whether the people we employ can continue to co-exist peacefully. "", ""The only person who seems to really get it, other than Vimal Shah (who clearly has abandoned Bidco for now), is Keroche CEO Tabitha Karanja. As I type this, all I have is the invitation to her press conference. Since it will happen well after I have submitted this column, I can only hope other captains of industry and business leaders can enjoin their voices to her's and Vimals and call for sanity as we go into the March 4 elections and beyond. "", ""So why do we feel so uncomfortable with the worlds of business and politics colliding? Its a blowback that Howard Schultz says he gets from worried board members and shareholders. But I think it's time to recognise that being involved in policy is not the same thing as being partisan. Getting off the sidelines is not the same thing as choosing sides. Let me say that again for emphasis: Getting off the sidelines is not the same thing as choosing sides. "", 'As Schultz put it, this is not an issue of ""being a Republican or a Democrat""  instead, he says, it\'s ""about being an American."" It\'s about ""trying to lead."" ', 'Let me try that using Vimal Shahs voice or that of Tabitha Karanja. Its not an issue of being Amani, or Cord, or Jubilee et al. Its about being a Kenyan in a position of leadership  its about leading and if ever Kenya needed leaders, it is now. Yes Boss, Kenya needs you.

So the outcome of this election and how we all continue to get a salary at the end of the month is paramount to them. There is no room for nonsense if you work here. As managers who work here, we take our cue from them. ', 'My chairman Kiprono Kittony, who is also the chair of the Media Owners Association, and his vice chair Wachira Waruru are pretty level-headed gentlemen no matter what you may have heard. Yes, if you wish to be myopic, Kiprono is Kalenjin, Wachira is Kikuyu. However, their commitment to a working, growing economy cant be dismissed or argued away. They are Kenyans, businessmen, leaders and everything else later.

There were others in the room, but these two really stuck their necks out. ', 'So, yes, I want a rallying clarion call from media for this election. Lead! Not after the fact, but right now, set the tone as we countdown to election Day.

To do otherwise is not just shortsighted; it\'s an abdication of responsibility. As Howard Schultz challenged US executives in the lead-up to the US presidential elections in 2012: ""We all know that something is wrong. We absolutely know it. Yet we\'re sitting here as if everything is fine."" ', 'He went on to say When has more participation in our political system ever been a bad thing? Isn\'t that what government ""of the people, by the people, for the people"" is supposed to be about? ', 'The question is this: ""Are. You. A bystander?"" Or are you a leader? If you are a leader, you will be hearing from me, or from Carole Nkirote at Kepsa. Step up  Kenya needs you. Kenya needs leaders.
