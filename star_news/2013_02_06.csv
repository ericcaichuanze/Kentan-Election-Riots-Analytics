The\nchildren may however be in need of basic needs and further education.\nWhen such parents absolve themselves from their duties, they leave the\nchildren without any help. ', ' ', 'The Childrens Act has\nappreciated the circumstances and the need to have parents to provide\nfor their children, until the children have the ability to provide for\nthemselves.

But the question is; what does it mean to vote wisely? What will guide Kenyans into casting their vote wisely? ', 'So far, there are three leading presidential tickets slugging it out for top honours the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord) led by Prime Minister Raila Odinga, the Jubilee Coalition of Uhuru Kenyatta and the Amani Coalition of Musalia Mudavadi.', 'In this regard, voting wisely would mean choosing one of these coalitions above the rest. But given the nature of our society, the history of our country and the challenges we face today, what should Kenyans consider most in order to vote wisely?', 'The issue majority of Kenyans will, undoubtedly, be considering most when they cast their ballots on March 4 is which leadership can be trusted with the implementation of the new constitution. In this regard, the implementation of the constitution will, most likely, be the top issue on the mind of majority of voters.', 'History shows that the March 4 elections present the same challenges the nation faced 50 years ago when the country attained independence in 1963.', 'At independence, the aspirations of Kenyans lay in the new structure of government that was anchored on a constitution based on devolution of power and resources, equity in distribution and sharing of national resources and a two-chamber parliament to ensure effective representation of the people.', 'But all those aspirations died and vaporized because the leadership that took over government was not committed to principles of devolution, equity and effective representation that the independence constitution espoused. Upon taking over power, they mutilated the constitution because they did not believe in it, thus killing the aspirations of Kenyans for good governance, equity, devolution and effective representation. ', 'Looking at the March 4 elections, one notices that the aspirations of majority of Kenyans, like in 1963, lie in the new constitution which provides for devolution, equitable distribution of resources, fairness in land use and ownership, two-chamber parliament, etc. ', 'The question, therefore, is who among the available coalitions can be trusted to uphold the letter and spirit of the new constitution? To answer, lets look back into history.', 'As the independence of African countries became fait accompli by the mid 1950s, certain powerful selfish interests had feared the coming of majority rule in Kenya. Nonetheless, the British government had to acknowledge that Africans could no longer be excluded from the political process in Kenya.', 'In this regard, the British administration introduced the Lyttleton Plan of 1957 under which the first African representatives were elected to the Legislative Council (LEGCO) of Kenya. ', 'They were Mboya, Ngala, Moi, Mate, Ogundu, Muliro, Odinga and Muimi their first legislative act was to reject the proposed Lyttleton Constitution which was an interim reform document meant to last until 1960, but which ensured the continued dominance of European members in decision-making.', 'After rejecting the Lyttleton Constitution, the African Legco members formed the African Elected Members Organization and sent Ronald Ngala and Tom Mboya to London as a delegation to press for an entirely new constitution one that was not only workable, but which would enable African members to accept ministerial responsibility.', 'By the end of 1959, the British Secretary of State declared an end to the State of Emergency imposed in 1952, and announced a conference to consider constitutional progress to be held in London in February 1960. Virtually the whole of the Kenya Legislative Council turned up to the first constitutional conference at Lancaster House, sitting under the chairmanship of Colonial Secretary Ian Macleod.', 'For those round-table talks, the African members of Legco had achieved an understanding with the joint delegation led by Ngala (KNP) and Mboya (KIM), in what Odinga later described as a precarious compromise.', 'The first Lancaster House conference thus resulted in a new constitution for Kenya, which came in force after the general election of February 1961. But before that could happen, the whole political process had to open to include the people. Incredibly, the African leaders had been operating all this time without the benefit of true political parties.', 'In May 1960, the first draft of the Kenya African National Union (KANU) constitution was adopted by its preparatory committees first national conference held in Kiambu. Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU) would be formed soon afterwards at Ngong, as well as other parties which embarked on campaigning for the forthcoming elections.', 'On February 26 and 27, 1961, the first ever general election on a common roll was held. Over 800,000 people voted with 84 percent turnout. KANU won almost half the seats in an outright victory but refused to form a government until Kenyatta was released.', 'KADU promptly stepped in to form a government of minorities but this proved to be an uncomfortable situation. Kenyatta would be released from detention in August 1961 and was immediately elected president of KANU by early 1962, he had been elected unopposed to Legco in a by-election at Fort Hall.', 'The new Colonial Secretary, Maudling, later agreed with a Kenyattaled KANU delegation to London that a new independence constitution should be worked out in Nairobi.', 'The second Lancaster House conference started on 12 February 1962 and lasted until May. It first examined KANUs draft and then turned its attention to KADUs draft.', 'But at one point in the proceedings, Kenyatta said that the Gikuyu must be allowed to take up land in Rift Valley, at that time largely owned by Europeans where the Kikuyu were employed as farm labourers and squatters. Immediately there was a long-drawn out Aaaaah! from the Kalenjin and Maasai representatives, and Willie Murgor, from Eldoret, produced a whistle and blew a note of alarm on it, thus establishing a whistle-blowing tradition in Kenya. This caused deep suspicion on all sides.', 'Maudling finally called for a compromise plan that would include the provision of a Central Government but with the principal of regionalism incorporated in it through the establishment of six regional assemblies that would have regional administrative and financial control and executive powers over local land. ', 'All crown and trust land would be under regional control, and the scheduled land would be under a special national board. Maudling was insisting on devolved government, and since everyone wanted independence as soon as possible, KANU and KADU eventually produced a final constitution, and a Coalition Cabinet government took office in May 1962.', 'The Times of London would describe the proposed constitution as a formidable instrument of government. It was one of the most involved constitutions running to over 233 pages of checks and balances.', 'For eight million people, there were to be two central government assemblies (House of Representatives and Senate) and seven regional assemblies, separate judiciaries, police forces, and public service commissions. In essence, the independence constitution embraced the concept of devolution the same way the 2010 constitution does.', 'But all this would go down the drain soon after the May 1963 elections which KANU overwhelmingly won. With a strong mandate from the electorate, KANU went to the September constitutional conference with a draft emphasizing strong central government since KADU had no clear mandate from the people to push for the devolved system.', 'With KANU calling the shots, there were major alterations to the 1962 constitution, including the setting up of a single public service commission, instead of seven regional ones, and the establishment of a single police force under the control of Central Government.', 'The government under Prime Minister Kenyatta was also empowered to seek the support of the electorate by way of a referendum if parliament could not see its way to agree to further substantial constitutional amendments. Thus the instruments of state power were passed to the new executive, legislature, and judiciary of the newly created independent nation of Kenya, on 12 December, 1963, in a very fluid constitutional condition, under the Kenya Independence Act, 1963.', 'The devolved elements of the constitution of Kenya could only be changed legally if 75 percent of the members of both houses of parliament voted to do so. While KANU had a large majority, it did not have enough votes to change the constitution.', 'Much public political debate and private political negotiation ensured, until, on the 10 November, 1964, all the KADU members of parliament in both the House of Representatives and the Senate crossed the floor to join KANU thus forming a political monopoly that could effect constitutional change. It was quick to come.', 'The death of the devolved system of government after independence came on October 7, 1964 when Tom Mboya of KANU rose in the House of Representatives in his capacity as Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs and said;', '...so, we propose that strong national leadership be assured by election of a president who is Head of Government instead of the illusory arrangement in which you have a constitutional President and someone else as Head of Government. This arrangement is just not understood by our people, it is foreign to them. The historical process by which, in other lands, Heads of State, whether Kings or Presidents, have become figureheads are no part of our African tradition. So, in this respect, we politely reject the Westminster model. The man we choose for our president will be the leader of our nation and the leader of our government, and this, Sir, is what our people understand.', 'From that day onwards, the independence constitution was mutilated through self-serving amendments by a rubber-stamp parliament thus killing all the aspirations for good governance that Kenyans had all this was courtesy of a leadership that did not believe in devolution of power and resources taking over government.', 'With the benefit of this history, majority of Kenyans head to the March 4 polls with the understanding that that the nation has come full circle and faces the same political challenge it faced in 1963. ', 'Many will, therefore, vote wisely and voting wisely means supporting the coalition that can be trusted with the implementation of the new constitution a coalition that will not mutilate the new constitution the way those who did not believe in devolution, equity and effective representation of the people did with the independence constitution.', ' ', 'The writer is the deputy Secretary General of Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims (SUPKEM) and the Secretary General of the Muslim Leaders Forum.

The disabled members of this nomadic communities suffer the most, with most of them dying young."", 'The Northern Nomadic Disabled Persons Organisation (Nondo) is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) formed by Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) from the Northern Kenya. It aims to improve the quality of life of PWD in the wider Northern Kenya, by eliminating all barriers that are hindering their full and effective participation thus giving them a platform to network, learn and have a voice.', 'It is the first organisation of its type that caters for these marginalised and voiceless group of people.', 'The executive director of the organisation, Harun Hassan said, In Somali culture if a goat is sick or has a broken leg, you slaughter it. If it wasnt for religion and the law then a disabled child would suffer the same fate. They consider such a child as stress and these children are never given the opportunity to get an education. Already with the gender issue and the low literacy levels, this child has no chance at all.', 'Northern Kenya is generally an arid and semi-arid area where rainfall is scarce and unreliable. The economic activities possible are pastoralism and small-scale retail trade. The counties of northern Kenya are ranked among the poorest in Kenya. It is isolated from the rest of the country by its lack of infrastructure.', 'Northern Kenya has all the makings of challenges for PWDs from the harsh weather, high illiteracy levels, escalating poverty to long years of marginalisation. In addition to this, many different communities-largely nomads - use the same resources of land and water. Tribal clashes, with livestock rustling and banditry, are a common occurrence in many areas.', 'Before the organisation started operating in the area, there was no plan to empower them. The culture associates disability to a bad omen. If you cannot build a Somali traditional hut or milk a camel or cook a meal, as a woman, you are disqualified as a wife. But for men, disability is only visible if you are poor. If you have a camel and some goats you can still marry. I understand that society doesnt intentionally discriminate against persons with disability but this is so because the level of awareness is low, said Hassan.', 'When families are moving from one area to another in search for pasture, the disabled are carried on the backs of donkeys or camels but in extreme circumstances where the family doesnt have enough beast of burden, they are left behind with enough food and the homestead is fenced to keep away the wild animals. When the family finally settles in the new area they go back to pick them.', 'For them, property is more valuable that humans, he said.', 'Hassan started the NGO after his own disability in March 2007. Before then, he too was oblivious to this group of people.', 'I never thought that I would ever be disabled and then I got in accident on my way to Mandera from Nairobi just as I was on the last 200km after clearing 900km. I suffered a spinal cord injury and I was paralysed from my neck down. I later regained the use of my hands. I spent a whole year in hospital.', 'Before my accident I had no interest in people with disability I never knew they even existed in the nomadic areas. That is when I started asking myself how they live here and what happens when the families start moving following the rain patterns. As a young boy I grew up herding goats and that is where the idea of starting an NGO that caters for the need of the nomadic communities sprung up.', 'I grew up in a trading centre so there was not much moving in search of pasture, he explained.', 'After the accident, Hassan had given up on life and asked to be taken to his rural home in Kutulo, Mandera.', 'There, I had decided to go and die. But once I got there, people of disability in the area came to visit me and talked to me. I accepted my condition and started getting healthy and having a better outlook of life. After this awareness, focus shifted from myself to the persons with disability in the region. I was happier. I had a purpose in life. I started Nondo, a mass movement of people with disability in North Easter areas like Mandera, Turkana, Wajir, Garissa, Marasabit, Samburu and Isiolo.', 'Nondo seeks to raise the level of awareness among PWDs, provide assistance devices-integration/participation-expensive; repairing; cost of transport and funding opportunities-poverty; awareness to access funding opportunities.', 'Hassan described the experience of working with the community.', 'I recently had a lengthy call with a mother who has a disabled child with spinal injury. I had to convince her not to keep her locked up in the house alone. I usually engage parents to bring out their children and let them be like all the other children. We have also trained parent who have children with disabilities to approach others who have not accepted their children, he said.', 'The organisation also provides education and economic empowerment.', 'Disability is only visible when you have no education. That is when we see the disabled poor and on the street begging. We have programmes on governance and urge them to participate in community affairs. There are some who told me that they do not need a national identification card because the police dont arrest them. This they dont have voters cards and dont participate actively in society.', 'Im glad that a teacher in Mandera who is a person living with disability is vying for a county representative seat.', 'I believe that when we are represented in all aspects of governance then the decisions made will have a positive trickle down effect to people with disability in far flung areas. If not we will continue struggling to ensure that we have a member in all school committees civil society, APDK and district development committees.', 'Some of the challenges that the organisation faces according to Hassan is access to the vast northern eastern region.', 'North Eastern is a vast area and efficiently penetrating it to provide services for the persons with disability is proving to be hard. There is also the issue of insecurity with the rampant rustling and banditry. The PWDs become the first casualties because they cannot run away fast enough. Some are even used as human shields.', 'Nondo, which has now been in operation for two years, was awarded the Malaika Tribute Award for Activist of the Year, which was presented by anti-jigger campaign ambassador Cecilia Mwangi during the gala dinner at Safari Park.', 'I was rude to Daddy Owen when he called me and told me I had won the award.

He claims that if his not reconsidered, it will result in  a miscarriage of justice which was likely to embarrass the court.', 'The defence respectfully requests the Chamber to: a) Refer the preliminary issue of the validity of the Confirmation Decision back to the PTC for reconsideration pursuant to Article 64(4). b.)

None of the documents recently submitted by the Prosecutor setting out its case  the Pre-Trial Brief, Summary of Areas of Testimony and the Updated DCC  assert that Mr Kenyatta was present at the 26 November meeting.', '""In the circumstances, a key fact underlying the confirmed charges has been established to be based upon a lie. The Defence evidence, which went to the truth of the matter, was in the circumstances wrongfully rejected by the PTC, says the application.', 'Uhuru says the fact that the pretrial brief for the April trials no longer specifically alleges that another meetingthe January 3, 2008 Nairobi club meeting took place is pointer to a weakened case.', ""Uhuru also says the prosecution severally misled Ekaterina's chamber on the nature of evidence it obtained from Witness Number 4. He says that Ekaterina severally failed to recognize that the evidence from the witness went to the heart of the prosecutions case."", 'The defence therefore submits that the single judge, by authorising non-disclosure of the full OTP-4 Statement failed to balance fairly the interests at stake, and as a result the subsequent proceedings failed to comply with the requirements of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms,"" says the application.', '\n']"
