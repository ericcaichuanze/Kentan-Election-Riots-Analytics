Those from China were worth Sh144 billion in the same year.', ' ', 'Analysts say India has managed to clinch the lions share of Kenyas import volumes because of, among others, the prevailing cordial foreign policy between the two countries since Kenya gained independence, relatively cheaper goods, quality, and proximity of its ports to Kenya.', ' ', 'The main imports from India include textiles, petroleum products obtained from bituminous minerals (other than crude), medical equipment and drugs, pharmaceuticals, flat-rolled iron and non-alloy steel products, electrical goods, food-processing machinery, special purpose motor vehicles and trucks among others.', ' ', 'There are quite a number of factors why Kenya is importing more from India. For instance, you will realise that many products on sale in Kenyan retail stores  such as textiles (garments)  come from India. They are cheaper and as we know, Kenyan consumers are sensitive to price, making these a top choice, said Tiberius Barasa, the executive director of the Centre for Policy Research, a governance and public policy analysis think-tank.', ' ', 'But we are realising that its not just about price but also quality that is standing out for Indian imports, and this is something that can definitely be sustained in the near-term. Regional proximity of India also makes it easy to travel to and to transport goods to Kenya, said Barasa.', ' ', 'The Indian High Commissioner to Kenya Sibabrata Tripathi echoes these sentiments, saying that a combination of factors does indeed make India a market of choice for Kenyan importers.', ' ', 'These include proximity, particularly of ports on the west coast of India, price-related factors and not least, quality of products, said Tripathi.', ' ', 'He says that although Kenya accounts for less than one per cent of Indias global exports, its importance as an export destination is highly valued by Indian exporters. ', ' ', 'They (Indian exporters) travel to Kenya frequently as do Kenyan importers to India and close attention is paid to the specificities of the Kenyan market.', ' ', 'According to him, there is increased Indian interest in Kenya as an investment destination as well, with Indian investors dotting sectors such as medical diagnostics, communications and petroleum refining. Indian firms are also gaining presence in contracting areas such as construction and ICT.', ' ', 'Indeed, a good example is Delta Corp East Africa Ltd  a subsidiary of Indias Reliance Industries owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani  which has huge investments in Kenyas real estate development.

The country has in recent years opted to ship even the all-important military equipment, vehicles and gear from Asia, China in particular.', ' ', 'Imports from the UK, for instance, amounted to Sh42 billion from January to November 2012  less than a quarter of imports from India in the same period.', ' ', 'Kenya and Indias foreign policies have been friendly right from independence, and neither country has regarded the other as enemy at any one time. What we have seen is the deepening and consolidation of this, and extension to sectors such as construction and services, said Barasa.', ' ', 'Kenya imported goods worth Sh19.3 billion in November alone from India as it further tightened trade relations with the Asian tiger. Imports from the UAE amounted to Sh13.2 billion, while Chinas were worth Sh12.1 billion in the period, according to the KNBS data.', ' ', 'The reason why China might be thought to be to be doing booming business with Kenya is because of its presence in key projects such as roads. Thats where it has an upper hand perhaps over Asian rivals, plus it can afford to give Kenya grants  thats its competitive edge. India has its own challenges and may not afford to give grants, said Barasa.', ' ', 'A trade imbalance however exists between Kenya and India, as the latter does not feature among the top 10 major destinations for the countrys exports. This is attributable to Kenya being a net importer.', ' ', 'Kenyas exports are mainly agricultural products such as tea, coffee and cut flowers as well as hides. The major destinations for Kenyan exports are Uganda, Tanzania, UK, Pakistan, Netherlands, Egypt, USA, Rwanda and Germany.', ' ', 'The bilateral economic partnership between our two countries should not be seen through the growing trade volume alone, Tripathi said, adding that diplomatic exchanges between the two countries, particularly at cabinet level, have played an important role in improving trade relations.', ' ', 'There are about 40 top Indian firms with offices in Kenya currently  including three banks and a number of insurance firms  which are proof of the increasingly cosy trade relations with Kenya.', ' ', 'India also offers lines of credit to its African partners, Kenya included, said Tripathi.', ' ', 'Commonality of business languages  besides the proximity of ports on Indias west coast, price-related factors and product quality  may as well partly explain the swelling trade volumes that have catapulted India to be top choice for Kenyan importers.', ' ', 'According to Barasa, relations between Kenya and India are likely to deepen and grow going forward as the country moves away from Europe and America to Asia and other Africa countries.', ' ', 'There is a big market here for Indian goods which India may not want to lose, he said.', ' ', 'The Indian business community has also in recent years become active in participating in both product-specific and general trade fairs held in Nairobi, facilitated and co-ordinated by the High Commissions Commercial Office.', ' ', 'In addition, a growing number of young Kenyans are opting to study or train in India either on scholarships or self-sponsorship, which shows the relationship between the two countries goes beyond raw business if we can put it so.', ' ', 'We, in association with the Government of Kenya, administer over 100 fellowships up to doctoral level under the India Technical and Economic Co-operation (ITEC) and other programmes, said Tripathi.', ' He said Kenya is also an emerging market for Indian tour operators, while Indian consultants offer services in areas ranging from road construction to hotel management.', '\n']"

He is the Safina party presidential candidate. Last week he appeared on the newly launched KissTV primetime news JSO @ 7 hosted by John Sibi Okumu. Here are excerpts of the interview transcribed by Star reporter Sharon Macharia ', 'Mr Paul Kibugi Muite you are aspiring to become president of this country as leader of the Safina party... ', 'May I start by correcting you. Before receiving the certificate of nomination I was an aspirant now I am a candidate. ', 'Oh! John I doubt that anyone certainly not me would take the serious step of running for the office of president casually. Two I have not had the money to flash around with helicopters but there has been a lot of preparation. I have been to more than 30 counties on the ground talking to people. I may not have been flamboyant in terms of even attracting media attention but I have been around, that is how we got over 2,000 registered voters joining the party in more than 30 counties. ', 'I have not abandoned or ignored them, I am just saying what I have covered. Before the elections and in the remaining time I will cover the remaining counties, there is no county that I would want to ignore I am just answering your question this is not something casual, I have been to the ground. ', ""I think that is, let me dismiss it as silly, not true and far-fetched. Anybody who has studied the track record of Mr Muite will know that I cannot be used by anyone to serve anyone's agenda."", ' When some of us have sacrificed and given the best part of our lives. John its been a sacrifice in the personal level, in the material level, in the level of liberty it has not been a walk in the park, ushering in multi-partism, ushering in democracy, increasing the democratic spirits. Some of us had a vision for this country, the new constitution was not an end to itself we knew it was a means to an end. That vision is yet to be realised. ', 'Listen John no country in Africa can continue to live on borrowed time permanently and this ethnic balkanization playing our politics which by the way is forbidden in the new constitution, forbidden even in the Political Parties Act, but we persist to mobilise along ethnic lines. We are playing around with time bombs. There has to be somebody who is a lighthouse. ', 'During the colonial times, the social economic policies in the colonial period favoured a small class of people at the top. At independence we adopted the same policies economically and socially, that is what was there in the first regime, second regime and even in the third regime. ', 'I was chairing the parliamentary committee on the constitution and legal affairs and the members of my committee said its our responsibility to guide the country on how the elections could be held that would be free and fair so that even the losers would accept the results. So we came up with a package of reforms, the top reform was the electoral commission.', "" We had proposed that the members who were going to conduct the 07 elections their names would be taken to parliament, be vetted and 'waidhinishwe na bunge' ...I would say that had the package of reforms gone through we would have free and fair elections, we would have avoided the ICC, the losers would have accepted the results. It was the refusal to accept that package of reforms that was purely targeted at elections to give us time to get a new comprehensive constitution that is the genesis of the clashes. "", 'And I said then and I say today that Uhuru Kenyatta and the other people at the ICC are not the ones who should be there, the Rome statutes is very clear that those with the highest responsibility accused number one should be mheshimiwa Kibaki, accused number two should be mheshimiwa Raila Amolo Odinga they were the candidates. ', 'Absolutely. ', ""Let me tell you John, I was not motivated whatsoever by ethnic considerations, Shem Ochuodho and I have been working together in J47 of which rejects ethnic mobilisation, which opts for issues and for values, which recognises that the core problem with Kenya is social economic. The problems facing the Nyanza people or Western province or Ukambani are the same problems facing the people in central Kenya there are very many poor people in central Kenya by the way. So it is an issue of the way we have managed our economy, our politics and our social policies. Those who mobilise along ethnic lines they are not doing it for and on behalf of their supporters but it's for there own political agenda. There are some of us who refuse that and who recognise it's the right of every Kenyan to be uplifted socially and economically and that's what Shem Ochuodho and I share. "", ""Well John Dr. Shem Ochuodho has been a member of parliament, I have worked with him closely in J47. I know his ideas that is what brought us together not 'ukabila' (tribe). "", 'A fundamental rearrangement of social, economic policies, so as to release the energies of a majority of the Kenyan people so as to uplift their quality of life. Let me be specific not just at the policy levels. A safina government for every shilling spent on the roads, rehabilitating roads, tarmacking roads we would spend two shillings harvesting rainwater across the entire country, we would have a very comprehensive policy of harvesting rainwater. Almost every two three years you get Kenyans dying through floods. The same year, the same Kenyans are dying of hunger and drought. How come we have never invested in a comprehensive policy manner harvesting that rainwater, so that is where most of the money would go to. We would invest in research in agriculture to come up with high yielding seed varieties for different agricultural products. Extension services to farmers, then policy interventions in terms of marketing so as to ensure that the farmer is getting an honest return... ', 'I would start with the most disadvantaged counties. I would start with North Eastern province then move from there. ', 'John may I say that the penny is beginning to drop with you, there are those who are saying they want to become president to continue with what president Kibaki has been doing. I am not for fundamental rearrangement, conservatives, pro-status quo, I am going to rearrange all that. ', 'I am not condemning anything. We went wrong in 1963, it has got to be corrected. Few people have got the commitment or the courage to do so I do. Even those historical injustices relating to land will be addressed. ', 'We have got a team. I am discussing policy, and believe you me, it would be reckless to come and disclose all your strategies on television. ', 'Take it from me, they are there. I am not just talking casually, this are things that we have gone through and decided that if you want Kenya to be catapulted from being a third world country, to being a second world, first world country, this is what we must do. ', 'Let me disagree with you and make this point that every Kenyan is a real person not just somebody with a big name like Paul Muite. My team have good ideas and are good intellects. ', 'They are there and you will see them. I am here to discuss the policies, they are there to implement it. Allow me to give this one final example, iron of very high grade is being mined in Taita Taveta. The person given a license stocks iron and when he has got enough to fill a ship, a ship comes all the way from Beijing its loaded, goes there and is smelted. Then we import steel and you know how expensive steel is. A condition for mining iron will be to build a smelting plant here. ', 'The cost of steel in Kenya will come down, provide employment, value added this is what I am talking about. Policies that target at giving an opportunity to the majority not to the few. Our economic social policies are targeting capital owners of banks, owners of insurance companies, big scheme land owners and so on.', "" We don't come up with policies that can give opportunities to a majority of Kenyan people, that's why we are one of of the most unequal societies in the whole world in terms of the gap between the rich and the poor. "", 'That is the root cause for the insecurity we have John. So even the wealthy and those owners of capital they should support Safina in rearranging this because we are not against wealth. ', 'However if they want to enjoy their wealth whether ill gotten or otherwise, they should support Safina government because only our policies will be able to bring back genuine security in the country. ', ""When you see these robberies, these carjackings and what have you, don't look at it purely as an issue of law and order, it is an economic social issue. Give people the opportunity to empower themselves and security will also get better. "", '\n']"
