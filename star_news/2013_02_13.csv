This is so especially with family property, more so, the matrimonial home. Husbands were the sole custodians and owners of the matrimonial homes and would therefore dispose them and charge them at will, without considering the effect of rendering the family homeless. The sanctity of the title document had the effect that if the husband was the only registered owner, then the wife had no rights over the property.', 'The new land laws introduced a new aspect in land transactions that involve matrimonial property. Firstly, spousal rights have been recognised as overriding interests in land. Section 28 of the Land Registration Act provides that unless the contrary is expressed in the register, all registered land shall be subject to the following overriding interests:', '(a) spousal rights over matrimonial property;', 'Section 93 (1) of the Land Registration Act provides that subject to the law on matrimonial property, if a spouse obtains land for the co-ownership and use of both spouses or, all the spouses', '(a) there shall be a presumption that the spouses shall hold the land as joint tenants unless', '(i) a provision in the certificate of ownership or the certificate of customary ownership clearly states that one spouse is taking the land in, his or her own name only or that the spouses are taking the land as joint tenants; or', '(ii) the presumption is rebutted in the manner stated in this subsection;', 'This provision allows for the recognition of spouses as co-owners of matrimonial property, even though the property maybe registered in one of the spouses names. The law further provides that if land is held in the name of one spouse only but the other spouse or spouses contribute by their labour or other means to the productivity, upkeep and improvement of the land, that spouse or those spouses shall be deemed by virtue of that labour to have acquired an interest in that land in the nature of an ownership in common of that land with the spouse in whose name the certificate of ownership or customary certificate of ownership has been registered. This provision is aimed at helping spouses who contribute indirectly in the acquisition of property but whose names are not included in the title documents of the property.', 'The law also requires that the spouse must give consent to any transaction involving matrimonial property for that transaction to be valid. Section 93 (3) provides that where a spouse who holds land or a dwelling house in his or her name individually undertakes a disposition of that land or dwelling house', '(a) the lender shall, if that disposition is a charge, be under a duty to inquire of the borrower on whether the spouse has or spouses have, as the case may be, have consented to that charge; or', '(b) the assignee or transferee shall, if that disposition is an assignment or a transfer of land, be under a duty to inquire of the assignor or transferor on whether the spouse or spouses have consented to that assignment. This provision is meant to protect the spouse and ensure that no land transactions are carried out without their knowledge and consent. The law further provides in subsection 4 that If the spouse undertaking the disposition deliberately misleads the lender or, the assignee or transferee by the answers to the inquiries made in accordance with subsection (3)(a) or (3)(b), the disposition shall be void at the option of the spouse or spouses who have not consented to the disposition. A spouse, whose consent is not sought, can therefore seek to invalidate the transaction on those grounds. Spousal consent is therefore not an option, but mandatory in all transactions involving matrimonial property.', '\n']"

', 'And candidates for Kiambu senator said that they variously intended, if elected, to help Kiambu youth acquire life skills, introduce modern technology in fish farming, or fight poverty at village level.', 'How Moi thinks that as senator he would buy a police helicopter is a mystery. Even a governor would find this hard: the constitution gives no functions about the police to the counties. As the law stands, senators will have no similar fund to the CDF to spend in their counties. Anyway, CDF funds have hardly been in the helicopter buying league.', 'What will a senator do?', 'The role is not to govern a county but is as a MP: of the about-to-be-reborn senate. Reading the constitution gives the impression of a very limited set of functions for the senate.', 'The main one is law making. But, though every Bill, or draft Act of Parliament, must be passed by the National Assembly, only Bills that affect counties have to be approved by the Senate. This means anything that affects the constitutional powers of counties, or their finances or elections to county offices.', 'A Bill about something to be done only by the national government, which does not affect what county governments do, will not have to be approved by the Senate.', 'In fact, almost all the functions given to the Senate concern the county governments. It is important in allocation of national revenue to, and between, counties once every five years. ', 'The Senate makes the initial decision (it must use the work of the Commission on Revenue Allocation, constitutional principles, public input, and the input of others including the county governors). Its decision is final unless two-thirds of the National Assembly reject or change it (then there is a procedure to try to achieve agreement).', 'The Senate has other important finance-related roles; according to the constitution it exercises oversight over national revenue allocated to the county governments, and this is backed up by detailed provisions of the Pubic Financial Management Act.', 'But when the MPs passed the Constituency Development Fund Bill last month, they removed provisions giving the Senate a role in overseeing the CDF, changing a proposed supervisory Senate Committee to a National Assembly Committee - even a parliamentary committee did not satisfy them  and providing that CDF Regulations must be approved by the National Assembly not the Senate.', 'It can require a commission or an independent office holder like the Auditor General etc. to submit a special report  it is unclear whether it can do this only in connection with the roles it is given or for other purposes as well.', 'It must approve any changes to county boundaries. And the Senate must approve any suspension of a county government by the President (if that government engages in actions that are deemed to be against the common needs and interests of the citizens of the county, says the County Governments Act) and can end a suspension. It also approves a town becoming a city (Urban Areas and Cities Act).', 'A county may appeal to the Senate if the Transition Authority decides that the county does not have the capacity to exercise a governmental function that the county wants to be transferred to it.', 'The Senate does have two truly important functions in connection with national government.', 'One will, hopefully, rarely, if ever, be exercised: if a motion for the removal of the President or Deputy President is passed in the National Assembly, it will go to the Senate which will appoint a committee of its members to investigate the charges, and if it found they were justified, the Senate could remove the President or Deputy by a two-thirds vote of all its members. Perhaps, rather more often, the Senate may be called upon to perform a similar role in the removal of a governor under the County Governments Act.', 'The other major role would be approving constitutional amendments, whether or not they affect counties specifically.', 'A Senator will no doubt be able to bargain for benefits for his or her county, as US Senators do: I shall vote for this Bill that you, the government, want only if you do this-and-this for my county  what the American call pork-barrelling. Their ability to do this may be less than for MPs  because they will vote on far fewer Bills.', 'Senators must clearly be people with sound financial heads on their shoulders, with good judgment, as well as all the integrity qualifications that Kenyans are looking for but that law makers have so dismally failed to require. And hopefully people who understand their job description.', '\n']"

Hence this Bill is coming at an opportune moment. How would this Bill contribute to the counties in economic development and stability?', 'The Bill proposes that the mining firms will have a year to sign the benefit sharing agreements that will also include non-monetary benefits after the Bill becomes law.', 'Mining and oil exploration companies are expected to sign fresh benefit agreements with counties that will be enforceable and deposited with the Senate if this Bill is adopted into law. This will remove such projects from the realm of social responsibility and make them legally enforceable.', 'Every affected organisation shall enter into a county-benefit-sharing agreement with the respective county government, the Bill says. This will essentially help communities living around the mining site to keep the firms legally accountable to the provisions in the agreements signed.', 'Communities living in areas where natural resources, including water and forests, stand to benefit further from the projects pledged by the firms.', 'The Bill also allows county governments to be in control of the mining activities going on in their areas and safeguard the interest of their population.', 'A county-benefit-sharing committee composed of the county executive committee member responsible for finance, the chairperson of the committee of the respective county assembly responsible for matters relating to natural resources, and five persons elected by the local community where the resource bestrides will be formed.', 'It also provides avenues for county administrations to make demands, including employment quotas, where the county demands a certain percentage of employees be from the devolved unit. This will help counties in provision of employment opportunities to the population through employment and contracts in supplies and hospitality. ', 'The county governments are also the biggest beneficiary in this Bill especially on revenues from fees and royalties charged on natural resources. Under the Bill, the county where the resource is utilised will receive 32 per cent of the revenues while the national governments portion has been reduced to 48 per cent.', 'Last year, Kenya earned Sh19.6 billion from sale of minerals like gold, gemstones and soda ash. county governments well-endowed with resources will have a stable flow of additional revenues and this is expected to catapult the local economies. For counties in the North, it is time to roll back years of neglect by utilising the proceeds from natural resources.

There has been conflict especially armed conflict in areas with abundant mineral resources all over; a notable example is the Niger Delta community in Nigeria which has taken up arms against multinational companies drilling oil in their area.', 'If approved, the Bill will settle squabbles over the sharing of revenue from natural resources including oil, gas, minerals, forest resources, water and wildlife. Currently, mining firms are only required to submit revenue to the national government, denying locals a chance to reap from the natural resources.
