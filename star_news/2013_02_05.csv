Theres no doubt that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Still, language is a beautiful thing and so, in spite of anticipating a rational, may be even gratifying answer from beloved Sudanese artist Ahmed Abushariaa, I ask the question: Why dont you title your work?', 'It was a routine enquiry, and I knew I might agree with his answer, yet I entreated him to respond in sweet English broken by delicate traces of Arabic. What words would he use to explain why he believed that words themselves, in the form of titles, were trivial? One of us longing for words; the other explaining why they were not necessary - the irony made me smile.', 'On Sunday, January 27, Helmuth and Erica Rossler-Musch opened their second exhibition at the Red Hill Art Gallery, a private gallery built just outside their home. Through NGO work and extensive travel throughout Africa, the intriguing couple have accumulated a large collection of African art. Settled between Banana Hill and Ngecha Village, they put up a modest gallery last year, to exhibit both their personal art collection and, every so often, the works of a different contemporary African artist.', 'In September 2012, they showcased the work of the late Geoffrey Musaka, who was a prominent Ugandan artist of international acclaim. This time, they are exhibiting works by Ahmed Abushariaa, a popular Sudanese artist living in Kampala. The exhibition, which will end in April, is open to the public on weekends and by appointment during the week. With over 50 paintings on show, it is a fusion of works from 1993 to 2012 - the largest showing of Abushariaas art in Kenya to date.', 'We were living in Kampala when we met Abushariaa and have been in touch ever since, says Hellmuth Rossler. We have a large collection of his work, only a few of which are in the current show. But Abushariaas romance with Kenya began long before this exhibition. In 1992, I came to Nairobi on a bus. I didnt speak any English, he tells us.', ' An old Mennonite couple, Bill and Betty Baumann from the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC) took me in and showed me how to promote my art. I worked at Paa ya Paa Gallery then. The Baumanns returned to Philadelphia and Abushariaa says he thinks about them often and still hears from them once in a while.', 'In 1990, Abushariaa graduated with a B.A. in Fine Arts from the College of Fine and Applied Arts from Sudan University. He worked as a graphic designer for two years and left for Kenya when the military took over in Sudan. In 1994, after two years in Kenya, he moved to Cologne, Germany where he continued working as a contemporary artist. Visiting Kampala as an exhibiting artist at the AKA Gallery, he met his wife, fell in love and decided to stay.', 'Today, Abushariaa is a celebrated international artist who has permanent exhibitions in Kenya, Uganda, Sudan and South Africa. He has exhibited in Europe, the US, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Australia and is a member of the Sudanese Artists Association, the Drawing Society and the South African Society of Artists. An upbeat, creative soul, whose work speaks to so many people across the globe, he is the real McCoy; a successful contemporary African artist.', 'Abushariaas blurred watercolours, nostalgic of his homeland, express sentiments from the 20-year war in South Sudan and the genocide of the Nubian people. At the time he fled Sudan, the authorities had banned artists from sharing such sentiments. ', 'Today, that is exactly what Abushariaa does. With hints of old and new Sudan, distinct elements of Nubian culture, Nubian symbolism and Arabic calligraphy, Abushariaas works indulge the senses, and are almost too much to bear when all in one room.', 'Each Abushariaa painting, semi-abstract and often made of several miniature paintings in one, deserves its own space. At the current exhibition, the powerful images, delightful colour and ambient form can be overwhelming. You see imagery reminiscent of rock-art; warm, organic watercolour paintings in oranges and browns; neat works in bright colours with a graphic-design feel; collages made of recycled material and newspaper, and his latest works of acrylic on canvas.', 'And so - Abushariaa gives me a moment of his time. I feel when you give a painting a title, you dictate the painting, he says. He believes it is counterproductive to confine an interpretation because people will not come up with their own ideas. ', 'If I called a painting The Festival, you would look for a festival and miss everything else. I enjoy paintings where there are several stories to see. People sometimes tell me to simplify my works but I like to have many pictures and then leave my work untitled. Titles make things confusing. I want to keep my paintings free, open to interpretation, with no restrictions at all. ', 'From different phases in his evolution, and using a different technique in each painting, Abushariaa has two works in opposite corners of the gallery that convey a similar sentiment. ', 'From a series of striking black and white ink works, there is an image of a stark, white silhouette, a female in Muslim dress, against a convoluted cityscape of black, grey and hints of white. ', 'On a small wall in a corner, there is an image where a colourful townscape occupies only the top third of paper. White desert fills the rest of the space, with only a few indistinguishable figures in traditional dress scampering in the nothingness.', 'Composing the foreground in the first painting and almost all of second one, Abushariaas use of negative space is profound. He feels no pressure to paint the whole picture or fill the void. Its also unclear whether the people in his paintings are moving toward or away from town. Playing with the ideas of isolation and identity, of belonging and not, many of his works look at the individual as he or she reflects upon their nation, their hometown, their culture and the doctrines propagated therein.', 'Using sweltering colours and sensitive imagery, Ahmed Abushariaa contemplates the things we all do. Who are we? Who am I in this context and who am I separate from it? Until either he has the answer or we do, his paintings will remain untitled.', '\n']"

However farmers have found a new innovative way to turn worn out tyres into a mobile vegetable garden.', 'Just as people plant vegetables in sacks, old tyres can also be recycled and used to plant kales, onions or crops that do not have tubers due to limited space.', 'The tyre-vegetable-gardens are a solution to city homes or the informal settlements to help cut the cost of buying everyday vegetables and also improve the family diet.', 'Ben Momanyi, a technician at the Institute for Biotechnology Research, organic section at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology says you save on time and energy as you do not have to till land or even a garden to grow your vegetables.', 'By doing so, you also minimise on space because anybody can grow vegetables in tyres and put them in a veranda, corridor or balcony. All you need is a small spot to put the tyre and you are ready to do gardening, Momanyi says.', 'He attests that small spaces can be well utilised using simple skills and people in towns and villages can also practice organic farming right at their door steps. It also allows you to grow a variety of crops in one tyre.', 'With a tyre, another advantage is that it is portable and in case you are moving houses, you can carry it with you, he explains.', 'Research has shown that there is no appreciable risk in using recycled tires in the vegetable garden. While it is a fact that rubber tires do contain minute amounts of certain heavy metals, the compounds are tightly bonded within the actual rubber compound and do not leach into the soil. One of the ingredients in the rubber recipe is zinc. Zinc, in fact, is an essential plant element.', 'Also the black rubber of the tyres will absorb warmth from the sun during the day, and will hold the heat, keeping plants warm into the evening hours.', 'In Kenya, majority of the daily budget goes towards purchasing food especially in the urban households where most of the population earns less than two dollars a day.', 'According to the Food Agricultural Organisation, home gardens have a great potential to improve food security at the household level and alleviate micronutrients deficiencies. Further stating that when access to land and water is not a major limitation, a well-developed home garden has the potential to supply most of the daily non-staple food a family needs and hence save of food bill.', 'How to make your own easy and economical mobile vegetable process.', 'First of all lay the tire at the spot where you want it. Then you can use a knife to cut the sidewall completely out of the upper side of the tyre. This helps to nearly double the planting area available.', 'Then prepare compost from well decomposed materials, and spread a plastic bag at the base of the tyre. You need to ensure the bag is strong enough as this will form the foundation of the tyre-vegetable-garden.', ""Mix your compost manure thoroughly with soil. This is a crucial part as the soil feeds the plant so it must be well prepared. Then put the mixture in the well-established foundation and add water ensuring it is evenly distributed. As the water settles, get your ready seedlings and plant them. Avoid using regular garden soil, which will become hard and compacted once it's placed in the tire, and can also contain weed seeds and insects, Momanyi explains."", 'You can plant kales, spinach, green (non-bulb forming) onions or the black night shade; however it is not advisable to plant tubers such as potatoes and carrots because of the depth of the tubers.', 'Indigenous vegetables are best for this kind of farming as a farmer can harvest them for as long as one year before planting again. Hybrid on the other hand have a lifespan of between five to six months but either way they both give the end produce and help in saving time and money.', 'You can do finishing touches by mulching which helps the soil in retaining moisture and prevents weeds from growing. From then on you only need to keep watering your crops, said Momanyi.', 'For safety measures, you can put the tire-vegetable-garden in a raised platform to protect the plants from birds especially chicken.', 'If your tire garden is placed on concrete, raise the tyre slightly by placing it on boards, cement blocks or bricks to allow air flow under the tyre.', 'Momanyi says they train farmers once a month and encourage them to train others on these simple but useful skills. He advises farmers to embrace organic farming which is readily available and is often free from many pests and diseases.', 'We encourage people to intercrop and this is one of the principles of organic farming so that if one crop fails there is another one that will survive. Some crops also help each other in fighting pests for instance onions help scare off some pests, he said.', '\n']"

Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission & 2 others [2013] eKLR', 'Petition no. 574 of 2012', 'High Court at Nairobi', 'Constitutional and Human Rights Division', 'D.S. Majanja, J.', 'January 21, 2013', ' ', 'The High Court has ruled that unlike the right of citizens in the diaspora, whose right to vote is to be realized progressively, the right for prisoners to vote is one that is immediate and the State and its agencies must comply with the obligations that require that this right be realized. Such obligation includes the duty to promote, protect and fulfil the right to vote. The court observed that the respondents had violated the rights of persons in prisons by failing to facilitate and promote their rights as prescribed under Article 83 (3) of the Constitution.', 'This ruling was elicited by a petition filed by Kituo Cha Sheria (petitioner) with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as the 1st respondent and the Attorney General as the 2nd respondent. The Legal Resources Foundation was enjoined as an interested party to the petition. The petitioner sought relief for violation of fundamental rights of prisoners to be registered as voters and their right to vote in the coming general election and other future elections and referenda.', 'It was the petitioners case that the exclusion of prisoners from the voter registration exercise by the IEBC violated the prisoners constitutional rights. It contended that Article 83 of the Constitution sets out the qualifications of a voter and being imprisoned did not disqualify a citizen from voting, and that the only prisoners precluded from voting were those who had been convicted of committing an election offence during the preceding five years. It was submitted that the only internal limitation to the right to vote related to the rights of persons in the diaspora to vote in Article 82(1) (e) which right was to be realised progressively. The petitioner sought orders that the High Court should compel the IEBC to extend the registration period for purposes of facilitating prisoners registration as voters.', 'Mr Muhoro, counsel appearing for the IEBC submitted that prisoners had the right to vote in the elections, contending that the IEBC had maintained the same registration and polling centres that were established and had continued to register voters in prison. However, he opposed the petition on the ground that the IEBC had taken measures to ensure that prisoners are registered and that it had taken adequate steps to ensure their right to vote.', 'The main issues for determination before court were whether the prisoners had a right to vote under the Constitution and whether that right had been violated by the respondents in the circumstances.', ' ', 'Determination by the Court:', '1. The Constitution as the supreme law is founded on the sovereignty of the people of Kenya. This sovereignty is exercised through voting for representatives in the National and County governments who exercise delegated authority of the people in accordance with Article 2. It is beyond argument then that the right to vote is fundamental to our system of government. ', '2. The Constitution, with its emphasis on the peoples sovereignty, the values on rule of law, equity, inclusiveness, equality, human rights as well as the right to vote guaranteed under Article 38 and the qualification of voters provided under Article 83 does not exclude prisoners from being registered to vote and consequently voting in an election.', '3. Apart from merely guaranteeing the right, the Constitution places upon the State and its agencies the positive responsibility to ensure that all the people of Kenya and particularly those who are marginalised or vulnerable are able to exercise this fundamental right. That responsibility is not a passive duty but an active one imposed by the Constitution and particularly the Bill of Rights on the State and all its instrumentalities. Thus the breach of the prisoners right to vote entailed failing by the respondents to take positive steps to facilitate, promote and fulfil that right. ', '4. Article 51 of the Constitution neither limits the rights and fundamental freedoms of prisoners, which include the right to register as a voter and to vote, nor does it diminish in any way the responsibilities of the IEBC to prisoners. ', '5. Article 83 (3) imposes on the IIEBC a duty to take positive or affirmative steps to ensure that the right to vote by all Kenyans is realized. There mere fact of providing registration centres for prisoners cannot be adequate to facilitate the right to vote. Prisoners are vulnerable persons in society and they do not have access to information, documentation, electronic media and means to voluntarily register as voters like other free citizens.', '6. The duty to facilitate voting means that the IEBC must coordinate with other institutions to ensure that the right to vote is realized at least within the context of what can be realized within the realm of prisons. ', '7. Unlike the right of citizens in the diaspora, whose right to vote is to be realized progressively, the right for prisoners to vote is one that is immediate and the State and its agencies must comply with the obligations that require that this right be realized. Such obligation includes the duty to promote, protect and fulfil the right to vote. The respondents violated the rights of persons in prisons by failing to facilitate and promote their rights.', ' ', ' 8. The obligation of the Court is to give effect to the rights contained in the Bill of Rights and the fact that giving effect to these rights may be inconvenient cannot override constitutional imperatives. ', '9. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission must take necessary administrative arrangements even after the General Elections to ensure registration of prisoners like other citizens as mandated of it under Article 88 (4) (a) and the facilitation of the realization of the right to vote of all eligible inmates. ', '10. (Obiter, as per Majanja, J.) The uncontested evidence demonstrates that this petition would have been unnecessary had the IEBC answered the correspondence from the petitioner and interested party. In an era where the Constitution obliges public institutions to be accountable and transparent, it is important that public institutions respond to queries raised by civic minded citizens. I would hasten to add that the right of access to information guaranteed under Article 35 underpins the values in Article 10(c) of good governance, integrity, transparency and accountability. ', 'The court allowed the petition and directed the IEBC to facilitate, in conjunction with the prison and other government institutions, the exercise of the right of prisoners who had already registered as voters to do so in the coming general elections. The court also ordered the IEBC to bear the petitioners costs and one-half of the interested partys costs.', '\n']"

Yesterday a Lands ministry official told a Nairobi court that the title was ""fake"".', 'Fraudsters apparently hijacked the identity of Dorothy Jemutai Yator and portrayed her as the owner of the land before selling it to Ruto.', 'According to documents produced before Justice Rose Ougo, Yator would have been six years old when the title was allegedly issued to her by the Lands registry.', 'The photo attached to the land transaction documents also did not resemble Yator who appeared in court for the first time yesterday. Principal Land Administration Officer Kiogora Mburugu said Yator was a victim of ""misrepresentation and forgery.""', 'Mburugu said the ministry was still ""investigating"" the fraud. No-one at the Lands Ministry has been charged with any offense or disciplined to date. Ruto, Uhuru Kenyatta\'s running mate in the presidential election, bought the 86 acre farm in Turbo, Uasin Gishu in September 2008.', 'However Adrian Gilbert Muteshi then filed a case claiming that he had owned the farm since 1968. Last year Ruto held a press conference where he said the court case was part of a ""grand scheme"" to link him land grabbing after the post-election violence. Later he agreed to return the farm to Muteshi but the agreement foundered after the IDP demanded compensation as well.', 'Yesterday the former MP was in court but opted not to testify. He had previously stated that he had done due diligence and had no reason to doubt the validity of the land title.', 'Hosea Ruto, a friend of William Ruto, yesterday told court that the ex-MP dealt with with two middle men who worked at the Uasin Gishu district settlement office and who were handling the transaction on behalf of Yator. ', 'Hosea said he personally went to inquire about the ownership of the land on behalf of the then MP. He said he went to the Uasin Gishu district settlement office where he met Peter Kosgei and Bethuel Kipsang who showed him the title deed and took him on a tour of the land.', 'The two men informed him that the land belonged to Yator who was ""part of them"" and that Yator was married to a Mr Kiptugen who works with the Lands ministry.', 'Hosea then introduced the two men to Ruto who paid for the farm in several installments with the final payment of Sh600,000 being handed over by Hosea himself. Hosea said he never heard Muteshis name during the transaction.', 'Muteshi filed his case in 2010 accusing Ruto of grabbing his 100 acre farm in Turbo, Uasin Gishu District. He said he farmed the land until 1992 when his business was temporarily interrupted by tribal clashes. He resumed farming after the violence but had to abandon the farm again following the chaos after the disputed 2007 election.', 'He was informed that Ruto had taken over the land when he returned to his farm after the turmoil. Muteshi said his six workers were evicted from the farm.', 'He claimed he acquired the land in the Kaptabei Scheme in the 1960s from Mr Edmund who was the white settler owner. Muteshi said that he applied to the then Lands minister, the late Jackson Harvester Angaine, for approval to buy the land in May 1968, . ', 'The application was approved on October 3, 1968, after paying the required amount plus development cash, Muteshi said. He signed a sale and loan agreement with the Settlement Fund Trustees at the same time and was expected to repay the loan over 30 years. However he only acquired a land title in 1989.', ""Muteshi must be honest. Allegations that he was at the farm in 2008 is actually a fraud. I've been the area MP for 15 years and nobody lived on that farm. The last time somebody was seen on the farm was in 1992. Muteshi was not living in the farm in 2008, Ruto told a press conference last year."", '\n']"

Vulnerability in one country affects others in ways that were hitherto unimaginable.

High food, energy and commodity prices, persistent income inequality, climate change and environmental degradation cast a long shadow on our collective prosperity.', 'Public policy is the best mechanism we have to deal with collective challenges. Policies are broad statements of purpose and process for addressing a particular social, economic or environmental issue.

American philosopher, John Dewey, argued that policies must be treated as experiments, with the aim of promoting continual learning and adaptation in response to experience over time.', 'Whether the goal is to address infant mortality or free education or water and sanitation or energy or agriculture or conservation, policy-and decision-makers face significant uncertainty. Policies that cannot perform effectively under dynamic and uncertain conditions face the risk of not achieving the intended purpose, and undermining the capacity of societies to cope with or adapt to change.', 'In a world fraught with uncertainty we need a resilience approach to policy design and implementation.

An adaptive approach to policy making understands and appreciates dynamics, uncertainty and complexity of socio-economic and ecological interactions.', 'An adaptive approach to policy making could make societies and economies more resilient to external shock and supple in response to rapid change and surprise. Some policy scholars have suggested that we should treat policy making as gardening: muddy, attentive and experiential, because we have no idea what growing conditions will prevail.', 'I argue that public policy must be designed to be more flexible and adaptive, to respond to unanticipated conditions in order to reduce the risks of policy failure as foundational assumptions of their design come against the headwinds of change.', 'Building adaptive policy is not the task of a single actor or a single sector, no matter how innovative. Rather, building adaptive public policy, which, are resilient over time, requires building foresight, forging coalitions across society, decentralising decision authority and committing to continual learning.
