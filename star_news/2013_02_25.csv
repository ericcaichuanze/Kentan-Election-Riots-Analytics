The TV stations are unlikely to be getting into this business as missionaries; that is unlikely to be their newfound contribution to philanthropy at election time. ', 'Politicians know that election time is when there is a high premium to adverstise and the media falls into good times in such moments. Bring popular politicians on the screen for a verbal duel and all their supporters and detractors will no doubt be glued. Advertisers will no doubt scramble for space, definitely at a premium price. Now, begin following my trend of thought if you are still wondering where I am going.', 'Second, which politician will, therefore, like to be used opportunistically as Raphael Tuju put it? To begin with, a participant in the debate such as President Uhuru and Raila would need full disclosure about DBL: Its directors, the purpose for which the firm was set up and whether any other political entity  locally or abroad  has some interest or influence on it. These are pertinent issues that cannot be swept under the rug. DBL should be aware that sections of the public are asking these questions. Kenyans have become much more aware of their need to know than ever before.', 'Third, both Raila and Uhuru are themselves walking television stations. In other words, wherever they are, the media will run after them looking for news. They sell. But they have never asked any media owner to pay them royalties although they make money for them. They get something in return which is difficult to quantify  publicity. Ask yourself now, why would Raila and Uhuru risk getting some publicity whose content they are not sure of, when they know fully well that just by staying away from the debate that will itself be news? I may sound like a cynic but the question is worth asking. Swallow that and I will tell you another.', 'Fourth, I have talked about content, let me elaborate. In the US, where such debates have become an accepted tradition, there are some procedures that are always followed, and which are well known to both the candidates and the debate organisers. In fact, these procedures were worked on quite some time ago to the extent that they have become part of the political culture in that country. In our case, these procedures still exist in the heads, or perhaps the files, of institutions such as DBL. Advertising these procedures in the newspapers and assuming that presidential candidates will read and agree with them automatically is perhaps presumptive at best and naive at worst. ', 'My advice would run something like this. Put in the newspapers an announcement that you would like to have an open forum on presidential debates to which all political parties are invited. Simultaneously to that announcement, write a much more detailed letter to all those who have announced intentions to be president to come and participate in the forum, or send their representatives. This should have been done early last year. It would have set the ball rolling on this discourse that would have made most candidates have a  buy in much earlier rather than be confronted with a fait acompli katika kipindi cha lala salama as we witnessed early last week.', 'Fifth, make sure that such open fora gradually and systematically develop the content and format of such debates. Dont make the content and format be a sole product of an institution such as DBL. You are not manufacturing a detergent, where the scientist is the only person who knows the formula. You are dealing with a very versatile, fluid, sensitive and at times slippery social phenomenon called politics. Even the best political players dont know where its boundaries begin or end: They are constantly seeking to keep it in control, manipulate and shape it to their advantage. Why do you think that you can thrash out matters outstanding in organising a debate in less than two weeks when those matters have only been isolated by you and not the key players?', 'Sixth, take note that the key players are not always the key players. While it may be easy to identify the major candidates as the key players, you cannot always rule out the minor candidates as not being the key players (please note my quotes). DBL decided on a solution that was itself part of the problem. This problem could have been sorted out much more systemically had the right procedure been adopted in the first place. But it wasnt.', 'Seventh, please ask yourself the question, how useful are the presidential debates in the Kenyan context?', 'My honest opinion is that they are useful in so far as they provide the voters with an opportunity to see and hear their leaders discussing pertinent issues that a presidential election should deal with. ', 'Further, they should also give journalists as well as the people the opportunity to ask the candidates questions about why they want to be president, and what they are likely to do when they get to power. Now, in the event that the candidates turn down the idea of taking part in a joint live TV debate for whatever reason, we should not cry over spilt milk: All is not lost though heaven appears to be lost. We can do the second-best thing: Invite each candidate to face a panel of questioners to ask him or her about the manifesto, plans for transforming Kenya for the better, how to deal with certain thorny issues as president and so on. The people will have the opportunity to put every candidate under the political microscope and judge for themselves. Due to time, space and viewership I would suggest we give this opportunity to the two leading candidates  Raila and Uhuru.', 'The Kenya Association of Manufacturers two weeks ago on Friday organised a debate between me and Governor Jack Ranguma at Acacia Hotel in Kisumu. The interview was shown widely on a few TV networks and solicited tremendous interest in the county. For those of you who may not be aware, Ranguma and I are standing for Kisumu governor Kisumu in this election. An initiative by NTV to have a rematch last Saturday did not work out because the governor had apparently travelled to Uganda.', 'Maybe the county government of Kisumu should, through a Bill in the County Assembly, pass an enabling legislation encouraging such debates. Such legislation should not be laced by the spice of seeking to control free speech and debate but should encourage a culture of dialogue and political hygiene in public discourse, especially during election time.', '\n']"

In contrast to this, numerous opinion polls have consistently placed the CORD Coalition ahead of Jubilee with the most recent poll saying that the election is now a virtual tie. The polls say, in effect, that no party can win this election in the first round. Who is right? The polls, without question. Though Mutahis argument has gained traction in certain circles, it is wrong-headed and the numbers on which it rests have been tortured to yield results they cannot sustain. This article explains the basic errors and spurious conclusions on which the Tyranny of Numbers stands. Put simply, the analysis is so flawed Mutahi should refund the money of the client that paid for it.', 'The Tyranny of Numbers makes a plausible but trivial claim, that is, that Kenyas voting is historically influenced by ethnicity. This claim is plausible because identity is central to our national life- as it is in Belgium, Lebanon and any other multicultural country you may care to name.  It is trivial because no one has ever won an election in Kenya through exclusive ethnic votes without mobilizing at least three ethnic groups and so undercutting the argument that people vote ethnicity. ', 'On the basis of that claim, Ngunyi then uses electoral demographics to build what, on examination, is a house of cards. The Jubilee Alliance, he says, begins with such a large numerical advantage the effort needed to secure an electoral victory is infinitesimally small. Barring a major catastrophe- including an assassination- Jubilee should win the presidential election in the first round. This inevitable victory comes from the Jubilee Coalitions bankable ethnic vote of 6.2 Million (or 43.2% of the total vote). This number is basically a totting up of the registered GEMA and the Kalenjin voters. On that same ethnic logic, Mutahi reckons that CORD Coalition starts off with 19.2% of the vote or 2.74 million votes. For CORD to win, he says, they need to double their support. Or as he puts it, for CORD to catch up with Jubilee, it must multiply each of its Kamba and Luo vote by 2.3. Virtually impossible is the implication. Well? This is numerology not numeracy. Here is why.', 'The Tyranny of Numbers is built on five easily exposed errors and fallacies. ', 'First, to say that Kenyans vote along ethnic lines does not lead to the conclusion that they vote for only their tribesman. Kenyans may mobilize along ethnic lines, a fact probably driven by weak political parties, but ethnic votes can and have historically split or moved tactically to politicians from other ethnic groups. In fact the only vote that has historically not moved is the Kikuyu vote. Mutahi analysis assumes that what is true of the Kikuyu is true of all ethnic groups in Kenya.', 'Secondly, even though the ethnic numbers seem plausible on the face of it scientific surveys, such as opinion polls, have consistently shown that Kenyans wont always vote the way Mutahi predicts. And that in fact, the CORD Coalition has a much larger base  nearly double- the Kamba/Luo ethnic core Mutahis calls their bankable vote. Contrary to everything Mutahi says, the opinion polls suggest, as they did in 2007, a rather close election that will most probably be decided in a run-off. In fact the polls suggest that the so-called Jubilee """""" head-start does not exist. By nomination day, CORD had already made up ground on Jubilee by increasing its core support way beyond its ethnic base of Luo and Kamba whereas the Jubilee leaders had not. In effect, CORD has no catching up to do.', 'Thirdly, Mutahi misses the effect of incumbency on elections. In 1992 and 1997 and 2007, the leading candidates for president, Daniel arap Moi and Mwai Kibaki, ran as incumbents. So is Raila in 2013. ', 'Fourthly, there are almost 3.5 million newly registered voters who nobody knows as yet how they will vote.  It is not possible to project historical voting patterns on this group. ', 'Finally, Ngunyis voter-turnout figures for the GEMA block are not plausible. The turnout blind spot leads him to grossly overstate the overall GEMA numbers.', 'FIVE RESPONSES TO THE TYRANNY OF NUMBERS', 'These five errors and fallacies mean that Mutahis conclusions are not just implausible, they are plainly mistaken and probably propagandist. We consider each of them in turn and provide evidence that refutes every one of Mutahi Ngunyis claims.', 'Proposition 1: ', 'Ethnic groups do not always vote for their own (Even when there is a viable ethnic candidate)', 'Leaving the fact of incumbency, which is discussed below, past presidential elections show that any candidate who relies on a narrow ethnic base, two communities, for instance, is unlikely to win no matter how substantial their ethnic base. More critically, except for the Kikuyu, an analysis of the elections that have taken place in Kenya since 1992 shows that all other communities have done one or both of the following: split their votes between different candidates from other ethnic groups or voted as a group for a candidate from another ethnic group. This is tactical voting not ethnic voting. It is based not on loyalty but on calculation.', 'Let us look at the election results since 1992 to see whether this conclusion holds up. Below is Table 1, with election results, expressed in percentage terms for the leading candidates in that presidential contest.

If no candidate met this requirement, a second round election between the two front-runners would be held.', 'The 1992 results show that 96.1% of the vote in Central Province, an overwhelming majority of it Kikuyu, went to the two Kikuyu candidates, Mwai Kibaki and Kenneth Matiba. But the two candidates did not do as well outside of Nairobi and Eastern Provinces, both of them GEMA strong-holds. Matiba made 25% in Nairobi, Central and Western, but he also made 25% in Western Province because Martin Shikuku partnered with him. Kibaki made 25% in Central and Eastern. But Eastern, mainly Ukambani, gave Moi 36.8%. ', 'When we drill down, some interesting things come up. Even though the Luhyas may have mobilized as a community, they nevertheless split their vote, giving some to President Moi and some to Matiba. This probably reflects internal communal disagreements about who would be best placed to protect their interests between Moi and Matiba, exactly the kind of argument we would expect to hear in tactical voting. It may be argued in rebuttal that the Luhyas would have been no different from the Kikuyus if they had a presidential candidate from their own community. ', 'Well, in 1997 they did and their voting that year clearly shows tactical rather than ethnic voting at work - see election results in Table 2 below. These results also show split ethnic voting in Eastern and Nyanza.', 'Table 2: The 1997 Presidential Elections by province, % age', 'Province', 'Moi %', 'Kibaki %', 'Raila %', 'Wamalwa%', 'Ngilu %', 'Turnout', '%', 'Central', '5.6%', '89.4%', '0.7%', '0.3%', '3.1%', '74.1%', 'Rift', 'Valley', '69.5%', '21.0%', '2.2%', '6.2%', '0.7%', '75.9%', 'Western', '44.9%', '1.4%', '1.9%', '48.2%', '0.5%', '68.1%', 'Nyanza', '23.6%', '15.1%', '56.8%', '1.6%', '1.7%', '67.2%', 'Eastern', '35.6%', '28.5%', '0.7%', '0.7%', '33.6%', '72.6%', 'Nairobi', '20.6%', '43.9%', '16.3%', '6.8%', '10.9%', '50.2%', 'Coast', '63.4%', '12.8%', '6.1%', '2.8%', '9.4%', '50.6%', 'North', 'Eastern', '73.2%', '21.2%', '0.3%', '4.6%', '0.5%', '55.9%', 'Total', '40.6%', '31.0%', '10.8%', '8.2%', '7.9%', '68.2%', 'Source: Constructed from defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya, ECK, results', 'The results of the 1997 election do not support Mutahi Ngunyis conclusion that ethnic votes follow ethnic candidates. Though the Luhya community had a presidential candidate, Kijana Wamalwa, they split their vote between Wamalwa and President Moi, clearly a case of tactical voting. That fact also underlines the fallacy of the Tyranny of Numbers assumption that in 2013 the Luhya vote is Musalia Mudavadis.  President Moi also won in Eastern Province, where it had been assumed, on ethnic voting projections, that the Meru vote would go to Mwai Kibaki, the GEMA candidate, and the Kamba vote to the Kamba presidential candidate, Charity Kaluki Ngilu. ', 'Indeed, based on exactly the assumptions that Mutahi makes in his analysis, the opposition failed to agree on one candidate to contest against President Moi on the logic that they could force a run-off by using their regional ethnic votes to stop Moi from satisfying the 25% in five provinces rule. But this logic collapsed with Moi comfortably winning more than 25% in Western and Eastern Provinces. ', 'Once again, the only community that voted almost exclusively for their own candidate was the Kikuyu. Kibaki got 89.4% of the vote in Central. It is clear that the Luos also voted by a very large majority for their own, Raila Odinga. But the fact that both Kibaki and Moi- who are neither Luo nor Kisii, the two communities resident in Nyanza - got as many votes as they did suggests more diversified voting choices among the Luo and Kisii than among the Kikuyu. ', 'However, and as the results of the 2002 election show, the Luo vote can move to a non-Luo candidate even in an election in which there is a credible Luo candidate. In 2002 they would ignore James Orengo, one of the leading lights of the pro-democracy, to move with Raila Odinga to support Mwai Kibaki. This is another example of tactical voting and not merely emotional ethnic voting. The 2002 election shows that the opposition leaders had recognized and their supporters had accepted that splitting the vote would hand an electoral victory to President Mois candidate, Uhuru Kenyatta. ', 'To round off the analysis of 1997 results, let us look at the outcome in the Coast Province. In this multi-ethnic province, nearly 2/3 (63.4%) of the vote went to President Daniel arap Moi, a Tugen. This means that the Coast Province actually voted as if they were one ethnic group even though it is one of Kenyas most ethnically diverse regions.

This means that the Kikuyu question was irrelevant: the election would have to be won outside Central Province. Indeed, all previous elections have actually been won outside Central Province. The results suggest that there is no two-tribe alliance between the Kikuyu and one other large tribe that could win an election in the first round, whether under the old constitution- a majority of the popular vote plus 25% of the votes in five provinces or even under the new Constitutions requirement of an absolute majority plus 25% in 24 counties. ', 'In all past elections, Kikuyu candidates  not supported by at least two or three non-GEMA leaders- have not generally done well outside of the core GEMA electoral areas. Of course this could also be said to be true of other candidates, except that no other ethnic based candidate begins with the same numerical advantage as a Kikuyu-GEMA candidate does. In other words, there is no basis for Mutahis assumption that because Uhurus core block has so many votes it necessarily follows that there will he will be able to easily mobilize the additional support he needs from other parts of Kenya to win the election in the first round. ', 'Some background will help fix this point. In 1992 the two Kikuyu candidates, Matiba and Kibaki only managed to get 25% or more in two and three provinces respecitively: Kibaki in Central and Eastern and Matiba in Central, Nairobi and Western (because of the Shikuku factor). Under the old Constitution, a combined platform would have had more votes than Moi but that does not mean that it would have won the election in the first round. It may be argued that the combined Matiba and Kibaki vote in the Rift Valley would have made the 25% required in that province. But, given that Kibaki failed to make the 25% vote in the Rift Valley in 1997 when he was the only GEMA candidate, it is possible that some of the votes that Matiba got in the Rift Valley in 1992 were not transferable to Kibaki and vice versa. In other words, there is nothing to suggest that if Kibaki and Matiba had joined forces they would have won the election in the first round without one more ethnic block.', 'In fact in 1997 when Kibaki was the only serious GEMA candidate he got 31% of the total vote but managed to make 25% in only 3 provinces:  Central, Eastern and Nairobi, core GEMA areas. It is only in 2002, with the support of Raila, Mudavadi and Kalonzo that he got more than 25% in all eight provinces. ', 'No GEMA Candidate has ever made more than 25% outside of GEMA strong-holds without substantial support of at least two regional heavy-weights. In fact, in 1992 Kibaki got less than 10% in all non-GEMA provinces. In contrast, Oginga Odinga who started out with a core vote of less than half of Kibakis core vote (if we believe Mutahi) scored more than 15% in three non-Luo provinces: Nairobi (20.2%); Western (17.9%) and Coast (16.1%). Though Matiba scored 18.7% in the Rift Valley, a reflection of the Kikuyu diaspora vote, he scored less than 11% in all other non-GEMA areas except Western. ', 'Uhuru is the only Kikuyu candidate who has ever done well outside of GEMA core areas- in 2002 - but then he was not seen as a GEMA candidate in that election. This fact was clearly manifest in the fact that he performed very poorly in all GEMA areas: he trailed Kibaki by a ratio of 3:1 in Nairobi and Eastern provinces and by a ratio of 2:1 in Central Province. ', 'But, if GEMA candidates do not perform well outside of GEMA cores areas, how does one explain Uhurus seemingly strong performance in precisely those areas in 2002? Unfortunately, that good performance outside of the GEMA core does not look as impressive analysed closely. ', 'Consider: in percentage terms, Uhuru got 10.4% fewer votes than Moi had in 1997 (see Table 4 below). What the data shows is that even with President Mois support, Uhuru lost very substantial grounds in all non-GEMA core areas that Moi had won in 1997. This means that his relatively modest 10.4% overall loss is thanks to the high population numbers in Central Province. His only gain outside of core GEMA areas was in North-Eastern, a region that had never voted against incumbency since the advent of multi-party democracy. The inability of Moi to transfer his 1997 vote- especially in the Coast, Eastern, Rift Valley and Western- confirms the general poor performance of GEMA candidates outside of their core areas. The question then is: 11 years on, how will Uhuru perform outside of core GEMA areas seeing what ground he lost even with Mois support in 2002? Is the Kalenjin gain from his Ruto partnership the only gain he is likely to make?', 'Table 4: How Uhuru Lost the Moi Vote', 'Province', 'Uhurus % age  vote in 2002 by Province', 'Mois %age vote in 1997 by Province', 'Change between 1997-2002', 'Central', '30.2%', '5.6%', '+24.6%', 'Coast', '33.4%', '69.5%', '-36.1%', 'Eastern', '26.1%', '44.9%', '-18%', 'Nairobi', '20.8%', '23.6%', '-2.8%', 'North Eastern', '67.1%', '35.6%', '+31.5%', 'Nyanza', '7.6%', '20.6%', '-13%', 'Rift Valley', '53.3%', '63.4%', '-10.1%', 'Western', '21.5%', '73.2%', '-51.7%', 'Total', '30.2%', '40.6%', '-10.4%', 'Source: Constructed from defunct Electoral Commission of Kenya, ECK, results', 'The Candidate Counts: Support for Moi in 1997 vs. Support for Uhuru in 2002', 'These numbers are not encouraging for GEMA candidates. It could be argued that the 2002 election changed the dynamics. That what was true before then is no longer so. It may be said that both the 2002 and the 2007 show the potential of GEMA candidates to do well outside their own core regions. This would be a plausible basis for Mutahis argument that with Uhuru and Ruto starting off with such a large base, getting the additional one million or so votes needed to beat CORD in the first round is a no-brainer.', 'However, before making that conclusion it is important to realize what happened in 2002. To begin with, contrary to received wisdom, there was no pro-opposition wave in 2002, if a wave is understood as an efflorescence of new support. The most instructive thing about the 2002 presidential result is how closely it tracks the 1997 presidential results. In 1997 Kibaki had 31% of the vote. Raila, Wamalwa and Ngilu had a combined total of 28%. In other words, the combined Kibaki, Raila, Wamalwa and Ngilu vote in 1997 was 58%. Compare that to Kibakis results in the 2002 election. The total vote for Kibaki in 2002- garnered with the support of Raila, Ngilu and Wamalwa - was 61.3%. In other words, the total Kibaki vote for 2002 in percentage is only 3.3% more than the combined total percentage of his votes in 1997 and those of Raila, Wamalwa and Ngilu. It is the combining of the 1997 opposition result, not the explosion of a new pro-opposition wave that explains what happened in 2002.', 'What do these numbers tell us? They tell us, even if somewhat tentatively, that in a three or four horse race GEMA candidates have tended to have very concentrated regional support from their core areas and not much support outside those areas. There is therefore no basis for assuming that once a GEMA candidate locks in the GEMA/Kalenjin vote of 6.2 (as calculated by Mutahi) then the rest of the 5.1 million votes (removing the 2.7 that he has allotted to CORD) will necessarily be a walk-over for Uhuru/Ruto. ', 'Let us now consider the 2007 election. That election tells us two additional things which are relevant to how we analyze the way things will pan out in this election. ', 'First, the fact is that there is now an in-built tendency in our electoral system- with the new electoral thresholds - to move Kenyan politics towards a two party system. In such a system, swing votes such as the Kambas would have been in 2007 and Luhyas will be in 2013 are critical.', 'Second, that election also tells us that starting from a high support base  as Mutahi claims that Uhuru and Ruto have- does not translate automatically into a huge electoral advantage over those who start from a low support base- as he says that Raila and Kalonzo have. ', 'The 2002 election showed that it was the fragmentation of effort that had cost the opposition the previous two elections, not their poor performance or Kanus good performance. All sides recognized that again in 2007 and that race became, in effect, a two horse race with the Kamba as a potential swing constituency which neither Kibaki nor Raila could take advantage of to decisively win the election. The 2013 election is also a two-horse race with the Luhya this time as the swing constituency. ', 'A little probing of the 2007 numbers is revealing. If we assume that throughout 2002 to 2007, Kibaki had not lost the 31% electoral base that he brought into NARC in 2002, then if the opinion poll figures for October 2006, which gave him a 41% support base are correct, incumbency had given Kibaki only a 10% gain. Over the next 14 months - from October 2006 to December 2007 - Kibaki would increase his support by a marginal 2%. Is this yet another case of the inelasticity of the GEMA candidates votes outside of their base?  ', 'That question brings us back to the second thing we learnt from the 2007 election: high starting thresholds guarantee nothing in electoral terms: the polls gave Kibaki a support base of 41% in October 2006. This was a seemingly insurmountable 28% lead over the 13% support base that the polls gave to Raila.

So the assumption of an effectively bound ethnic vote for each of the leading candidates is false, a fact clearly underlined by the fact that in the polls CORD is actually leading Musalia Mudavadi in Western Province.', 'Secondly, the fact that Uhuru and Ruto appear to start off with a large so called bankable vote does not make it any easier for them to mobilize the additional small vote they need to win the election in the first round. If this were a logical necessity, then Kibaki who started off with 41% support in October 2006 polls should have had an easy time mobilizing the 9% or so additional support he needed to guarantee himself 50% of the national vote in 2007. Instead, we had a situation where Raila, starting off with 13% of the vote in 2006, increased his support by 32% in 14 months to catch up with and surpass Kibaki in the polls and force Kenyas closest election.

The early polls in the early 1990s, as with all new things, were bedeviled by methodological challenges, political manipulation and a general culture of distrust based on misunderstanding how sampling and surveys work. But since 2002 opinion polls have generally been within the eventual results.  As a review of opinion polls in 2010 concluded the 2002 pre-election and exit polls reasonably and accurately predicted the outcome of the general election.

To answer that question and to see why the Tyranny of Numbers assumptions are spurious, it would help to review the polls conducted from October 2006 to the election in 2007. Those polls are important for two reasons: First, they show us, as already noted in the preceding section, that the support that one begins with (the GEMA/Kalenjin numbers, for instance) have no relationship with where one ends up. Secondly, they also show that polls are able to capture the evolution in the political landscape quite accurately.

More significant, he had done so before joining up with Musalia, (average 6% for the period) and Ruto (averaging about 4% for the period) in the Pentagon. Since the Luo vote is only 12% of the total vote in Kenya the doubling of Railas support means that he had an additional 14% support beyond the Luo ethnic core which Mutahi Ngunyi says is the primary determinant of voting in Kenya.', 'In the nine polls reviewed here, mainly by Steadman International (now IPSOs Synovate), and one by Gallup and Consumer Insight) conducted from September to December, 2007 during which time the Pentagon was in full flow, Raila led Kibaki in all but one poll, the Consumer Insight poll of November 21st 2007.

In fact, before December 2011 it had touched a peak of 48% (in October 2010). In the four polls done by Ipsos Synovate in 2010 Railas support averaged 40.5%. This means that throughout 2010, Raila had 28% support over and above the 12% Luo core that Mutahi Ngunyi makes so much of. Though that support base shrunk to an average of 34% in the five polls conducted in 2011, that number was still 22% above the Luo support base that Mutahi calls Railas bankable vote. That means that throughout 2011, Raila had nearly twice his so-called bankable vote outside his home turf. ', 'According to recent polls, that support has increased since the nominations were conducted in December 2012. Since then Railas support has been consistently above 40% and in the poll of polls combining the three opinion polls done between February 14-17, the Raila-Kalonzo ticket has 45.1% of the vote and the Uhuru-Ruto ticket has 43.7%, a statistical tie. ', 'However, when we do the ethnic maths that Mutahi asks us to do, the combined support for Raila and Kalonzo should be no more than 19.2%. If this is the correct ethnic figure, then if the polls are right, Raila and Kalonzo have at least 25.9% support outside of their ethnic core. In other words, the Raila/Kalonzo group has more support outside of their ethnic core than their combined possible ethnic vote. In contrast, the Uhuru-Ruto ticket has 43.7percent, only 0.5% above their combined ethnic vote of 43.2%.', 'Now let us do the maths that apparently shows that the election was won on December 18th 2012 when the voter registration exercise closed. According to the narrative of the Tyranny of Numbers, the combined GEMA/Kalenjin vote, assuming 100% voter turnout, is 6.2 million votes or 43.2% of the total vote of 14,337,339. And CORD has only 19.2% or 2.74 million votes. ', 'The fallacy here is easily revealed by the polls. On the CORD side, Mutahi assumes, correctly, that Raila and Kalonzo have the total support of their communities- the Luo and the Kamba- but concludes, wrongly, that that support  19.2% of the vote - is the full extent of their support base. On the Jubilee side, he makes the opposite error. He assumes, once again correctly that Uhuru and Ruto have the total support of their community but concludes, once again wrongly, that they have more votes outside their core support that they can mobilize. ', 'If the opinion polls are right, then there really is no real gap between CORD and Jubilee in terms of the support base. In fact, the polls seem to suggest that the total Jubilee support is entirely drawn from their ethnic base. This ought to be a matter of concern to Jubilee. Consider this a little closely. Until November last year, polls had given Uhuru a support base of about 23%. This was before he joined up with Ruto. That number is very close to the total Kikuyu vote, reckoned to be between 21%-22%. It is instructive that for a long while Uhurus support base was below his ethnic block vote, indicating that for a long time he did not even have the support of his own community. It is only after Uhuru joined up with Ruto that his poll numbers approached 40% and now 43.7. That number, as already pointed out is extremely close to the outer limit of the total GEMA/Kalenjin vote, 43.2% of the vote on Mutahis calculations. ', 'If Kenyans are voting primarily along ethnic lines, as Mutahi says they are, then poll numbers are suggesting that Uhuru/Ruto combination basically have no support outside their ethnic base of Uhurus GEMA region and Rutos Central Rift Kalenjin core. The conclusion to be drawn from the demographics and the polls is therefore the opposite of the one Mutahi draws: The Uhuru/Ruto core support is ethnically concentrated but the Raila/Kalonzo core support is ethnically diverse. Using the banking metaphor so beloved of Mutahi, the vote that Uhuru/Ruto can take to the bank closely matches the numbers of their ethnic base whereas the vote that Raila/Kalonzo can bank is larger than their ethnic core. There is just no other way of explaining the poll numbers against the demographics. ', 'Proposition 3:', 'Incumbency Matters', 'So far, the argument in this article has tried to show that the effect of ethnicity is over-estimated in Mutahis analysis. But as important is Mutahis blind spot with regard to the effect of incumbency on electoral outcomes.  One of the missing explanations for the Moi victory in 1992 and 1997 as well as Kibakis performance in 2007 is the fact of incumbency. ', ""President Moi did not run just as a Tugen, he ran as the President of Kenya. In 2007 Kibaki ran as the President of Kenya, not just as a GEMA leader. This means that one of the explanations for the geographical spread of his support base in that election is the fact that he was the sitting president. Similarly, in 2013, Raila is not running as a Luo leader, he is running as the Prime Minister of Kenya. The analysis from the 1992, 1997 and 2007 presidential elections show that incumbency is a factor.  If Mutahi's ethnic logic is correct, then Moi should have got only the Kalenjin and Kamatusa votes in 1992 and 1997. But he was the incumbent. He was not presented as a Kalenjin candidate but as the President of Kenya - hence the number of votes (widely spread in geographical coverage) he got in both elections. Similarly, one possible explanation for Kibaki ability to get votes outside the GEMA constituency unlike other GEMA candidates before is the fact that in 2007 he ran not as a Kikuyu candidate but as the President. Mutahi's argument stretched to its logical limit means that Kibaki should have only got votes from the GEMA communities. "", 'The truth is that Raila is now campaigning as the incumbent prime minister. The fact that the 2007 election was inconclusive means that, in effect, we have a re-run of that election, both at the personal, psychological level and at the ethnic level. Raila has, in truth, remobilized his support base and the fact that the poll numbers he has now look remarkably similar to his poll numbers in 2007 is not an accident.

It is not easy to say what the voter turnout will be but the historical trends are clear and there is nothing to make us think that this election will be any different. One large unknown, which has not been factored into the Tyranny of Numbers analysis, is how the newly registered voters, thought to be about 3.5 million, will actually vote. As we saw in the United States in the election last year, changes in electoral demographics can have a very unsettling effect on presumed voting patterns. One signal that there may well be surprises is the growing influence of Waititu and Sonko. These two are not ethnic leaders, contrary to what pundits might like to think. They are class candidates representing the underclass and enjoying support across ethnic lines. How mobilized is the under-class in this election?

', 'Depending on how it could affect various spheres of governance, many people, individuals and organizations, have expressed their views over the ICC issue. The National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) recently issued a statement saying that as much as they recognize the democratic right of the people to elect whoever they like, it would be impractical for the ICC suspects to govern the country from The Hague.', 'It should be noted that NCCK was one of the institutions at the forefront of calling upon the ICC to take up the Kenyan case they led a campaign to collect one million signatures in support of the ICC process and even led a delegation to The Hague to persuade the president of the Court to take up the Kenyan case. ', 'But the Muslim community, as a stakeholder in how the country is governed, is yet to say something about the ICC factor in the forthcoming polls. Although some Muslim lobby groups have openly declared their support for various political alliances ahead of the March 4 polls, there is need for the Muslim community to look at the ICC factor from a neutral position and make an honest judgement about the choices the country makes at this crucial moment in Kenyas political history.', 'First and foremost, it is important for Muslims to acknowledge that they have a huge interest in the stability of the government after the March 4 elections. During the post-election violence of early 2008 when most parts of the country were turmoil, it was interesting to note that the Muslim-dominated parts of North Eastern province remained peaceful and, in fact, many people from troubled areas sought refuge in North Eastern.', 'A case is told of how a man from Central Province who had to flee inter-ethnic violence in Kericho had to disguise himself as a Muslim woman by dressing up in a bui bui and hijab in order to get safe passage through illegal road blocks mounted by marauding gangs out to flush out perceived rivals from enemy tribes. This means that during the post-election violence, Muslims did not have the ethnic tag and therefore above reproach. ', 'But after peace returned in the troubled areas after the post-election violence, tables turned and the Muslim-dominated areas of North Eastern and Coast region became the theatre of violence and conflict mainly due to the threat of global terrorism that was heightened by the deployment of Kenyan troops to Somalia. As a result, Muslim-dominated areas are today the ones facing the most serious security challenges.', 'Although the security challenges facing Muslim-dominated areas like North Eastern and Coast are largely blamed on extremist religious and cultural elements, the police also share in the blame for their poor organizational capacity. For example, most of the victims in the Tana Delta violence go by the names Mohammed, Hassan, Halima, Zainab, etcmeaning that they are Muslim. But the Tana Delta conflict has had nothing to do with terrorism. It has to do with politics of resource sharing and the government has not done what it should do to address the root cause of the conflict.', 'In this respect, Muslims, more than any other minority community, have a huge interest in who becomes the next president after the March 4 elections. They need a government that will honestly and firmly deal with the huge problems facing the community. But such a government can only obtain if the people elected to run it have both hands on the deck and are available fulltime to address the peoples problems this is why it would be foolhardy for Muslims to expect people indicted by the ICC to effectively deal with their problems while away in The Hague seeking to defend themselves.', 'Then there is the issue concerning the possibility of sanctions being slapped on Kenya if ICC suspects are elected. Like NCCK, Muslims must acknowledge that it would be a dangerous gamble to elect people whom the international community is likely to blacklist. Today, Kenya hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world. Majority of these refugees are Muslim brothers and sisters from troubled Somalia, and their stay in Kenya has been made possible by international humanitarian organizations.', 'In this regard, if the international community gives Kenya a cold shoulder and ends up withdrawing or scaling down its humanitarian support for refuges because the people elected to lead the government are pariahs, will Muslims step in to fully cater for the needs of their refugee brothers and sisters who, in fact, live in the Muslim-dominated regions of North Eastern province? ', 'If Muslims are honest with themselves and their Creator, then they should broadly and sincerely look at the ramifications of the ICC factor in the March 4 elections and make an intelligent choice. Apart from the ICC factor, there is the land question, which Muslims should consider when choosing their leaders in the forthcoming polls.', 'The land question has genuinely become an important policy issue ahead of the March polls. Like many other Kenyans, a huge number of Muslims live in slums commonly known as Majengo. In fact, every informal settlement in this country that goes by the name Majengo is famous for hosting Muslim populations.', 'But the reason Muslims live in Majengos is not because it is their culture its because of the discriminatory land policies that have existed since colonial times and which were perpetuated by successive governments since independence. In this regard, Muslims have suffered in silence living in Majengos because nobody was willing to change the bad land policies that ensured they dont get legal ownership of the land they live on in these urban slums. ', 'But when the new constitution was brought to a referendum in 2010, Muslims voted overwhelmingly for it because it guarantees every Kenyan equal and fair access to land resources. The huge Muslim populations that live in the Majengos of this country supported the new constitution because they saw a great opportunity to change their pathetic situation as dwellers of urban slums.', 'Hence, if Muslims still have faith in the new constitution, they should honestly elect leaders who will faithfully implement the land reforms contained in the constitution.

For example, they gave this idea of ""party hopping"" to have been fixed for 4th of December.', 'So you are trying to suggest that our politics is not at all issue-based. Would the Cord coalition be the first government in Kenyan history which is going to focus on issues rather than personality?', 'Certainly, Sibi. As I said, there has been evolution in the development of political parties in our country since the introduction of multi-party politics in 1991/92.', 'Our trend here has been so very like what has happened in other countries: You saw what happened in Eastern Europe following the collapse of communism.', 'So, many political parties emerged but then, after a while, these parties began to coalesce and to merge so that eventually we ended up with two or three party systems. I think that our political party system must come of age in this country and we too will end up with two or three political parties.', ""Talking of coalescing, I don't think the names Raila Amolo Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka were ever deemed to be on the same side. Is this coalescing a Machiavellian construct that leads to power when bitter enemies suddenly come together?"", 'They say that in politics there are no permanent enemies or permanent friends. What is most important are principles and interests in politics.', 'So, are you trying to suggest that your differences with Mr Musyoka were as great, in giving that example?', 'I am giving an extreme example.As you know, I and Mr Musyoka have worked together: We came out of the Kanu system together. We formed the LDP together. ', 'We were in the Narc government together. We were together fighting against the mutilated constitution. We were sacked, or dismissed, by the president together.', 'We formed ODM. Eventually the ODM split. We ended up with ODM Kenya and we were ODM. So he renamed ODM Kenya: Wiper. But it is still chungwa (the orange).', 'We have come back together: the chungwa moja and the chungwa and a half. The differences between were much narrower and you now realise that, if we had stuck together, things would have have turn out very differently.', 'Your own experience Prime Minster of coalition government seems to indicate that you were short-changed. Should ODM be the key player, do you see other parties being short-changed under a Raila government? I am trying to suggest that the people in your government will be the beneficiaries of a reward system and not necessarily the best to lead this country. You will be paying back favours; political favours.', 'You see, ultimately, good governance has to do with institutions and respect for these institutions. What happened last time round is that we had weak institutions.', 'For example, remember the electoral commission itself had been appointed by the executive single handedly. They were supposed to be the referee in the game but they were appointed by one of the players in the field and, therefore, they were partisan and they are the ones who were really responsible for the mess that cost this country dearly.', 'Now, since that time, a lot of water has gone under the bridge. We now have a new constitution. Secondly, we now have new electoral laws and an electoral commission.', 'What we will do as the Cord coalition is to sincerely and faithfully implement this new constitution; to ensure that the playing field is level for everybody.', 'Prime Minister, lm still interested in the composition of your government. In the technocrats who will be part of your grouping. I am interested in the people that you might name as ambassadors to represent us abroad. I am saying it could be a case of favours returned.', 'Not this time round because things have changed. First the team being the executive, that is for example the cabinet, the permanent secretaries and the diplomats have all got to be vetted by parliament which does the due diligence and then sends the names back to the president for appointment.', 'So, we will no longer have the abuse of rewarding cronies and friends. Secondly, we want to establish a system that works efficiently. So, the recruitment is going to be done on merit.', 'It will also ensure that there is equity in terms of regional balancing, so that we do not reward other people, here and there. You mentioned my relatives earlier.', 'Let me just tell you that I have never at any time been involved in the appointment of my relatives for any position. My relatives are Kenyans. When they apply, they are vetted just like any other Kenyan.', 'I think that at this point we should give you some time, Prime Minister, as we have done with others, to elaborate on the Cord coalitions commitment to an equitable distribution of the countrys wealth. Is this just a high sounding phrase? Break it down into component parts.', 'Well, first of all, the constitution has provided for devolution and, in that, there is also a formula for wealth sharing. For example, in terms of the mineral resources of this country, if they are found in a particular county, what proportion will go to that county, what proportion will go to the investor and what proportion to the national government.', 'Thats why we are saying we are going to faithfully implement the constitution to ensure that there is fairness in this country. And there are other counties which are more endowed with resources than others.', 'And there is also a provision for a balancing. Thats why, for example, we are talking of equalisation of funds, so as to be able to bridge the gap that will exist between the counties, in terms of resources.', ""We as a national government will be like the referee in this process because we don't want 47 countries under one roof; we want to have one country."", 'We want to ensure that there is uniform development across the country. So, we will create structures and systems that will enable us to monitor and supervise development throughout this country, and in doing this we will be able to change and transform this country.', 'I have, for example, in mind what happened in Malaysia. Malaysia is a multi-ethnic society, and in Malaysia they have a formula for sharing the resources of that country along ethnic lines.', 'For example there are the Malays, the Chinese, the Indians and several other minorities. They know that if you are going to recruit 100 policemen, so many must be Malays, so many will be Chinese and Indians and so on.', 'So, in other words, if you are looking for merit and its a Chinese quota, it must be a merit within the Chinese because they might also have somebody.', ""Prime Minister you have this history of having fought for liberation, having been incarcerated for your beliefs, having been tortured. You were born in 1945. Is your understanding that this time it is do or die: If Raila doesn't make it this time it will never happen. Are these things that exercise your mind as you go into the elections? Must you go down in the history books as the liberation fighter who eventually became president? Is that how you see it?"", 'No, Sibi. It is not a zero-sum game for me. For me it is a calling: I represent a group of people. I represent a system or a movement. This movement has been in existence since independence. ', 'Remember that, after independence, there was a split between two opposing forces: The forces for retention of the status quo, those who wanted to inherit the privileged position enjoyed by the outgoing colonialists.', 'And they used it to lord it over their fellow Africans. And the forces who wanted to open up the society, and provide for popular participation by the people and their governance.', 'So there are forces that have been engaged in a struggle over this last 50 years. They have been pulling in two opposite directions: The forces for change and the forces for retention of the status quo. I represent the former.', 'For people who want to change this country and allow our people to participate fully in its development. To empower the people to popular participation.', 'If the people of this country elect me for the first time, the others will have eventually triumphed. In other words, we have been governed by the forces who wanted to retain the status quo.', ""Thats the reason why Kenya's potential has not been fully realised. Because there has been very ethnicised development. And thats why the countries which were at the same level of development with Kenya, and I keep on giving the example of Korea, have left us behind with such a huge gap."", ""Korea's GDP per capita income was at $79 in 1970 against 110 for Kenya. Today, the per capita income of Korea is $22,000 against Kenyas $460."", 'That gap is because of the way Kenya has managed its affairs. We can close that gap and I want to be an agent who will help our people to close it.', '\n']"
