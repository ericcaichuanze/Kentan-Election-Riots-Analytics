On the eve of the voting, we watched on television images of Administrative Police being dispatched to the west under circumstances that were murky at best and officially denied."", 'The GSU played a heavy role at the KICC during the post-vote tallying period and ECK Chair Samuel Kivuitu was whisked away under heavy security to announce the chosen winner with a small private audience and cameras only from the KBC.', ""As violence arose from protest and its suppression, and from gangs and militias which were in some cases sponsored by political players, people around the world saw the indelible image of Kenya's GSU, in full paramilitary battle gear, standing shoulder to shoulder, to protect . . . an otherwise empty park."", 'Thus, it was clear that the priority of the government was to control access to the politically-hallowed ground of Uhuru Park rather than to protect the citizens.', 'The Waki Commission determined that the largest single grouping of those killed were those shot by police.', 'From this background, I watched the course of the implementation of the so-called reform agenda over the years since. Reform of domestic security services has been crucial if Kenya is to become a fully functioning democracy in which the government operates under rules of law to serve the country and its citizens rather than protecting narrower political interests to the point of killing innocent Kenyans with impunity.', 'On balance, what we have seen from the current government is delivery of only a tiny fraction of the necessary police reform in the five years since the disaster in the wake of the last election. When the new constitution was finally passed in the contested referendum in the summer of 2010, it included among its structural reforms the creation of the new Inspector General post to lay the groundwork for a more professionalised force less subject to political manipulation.', 'Unfortunately, the priorities of those who ended up in power through the botched 2007 election and the mediated settlement have been since the passage of the constitution primarily elsewhere. ', 'How any of us could be surprised by that would be beyond me. Thus, it was not until late 2011 that the crucial implementing legislation, the National Police Service Act, was passed by Parliament. ', 'This is legislation that was crafted carefully with serious expert input and had the government than moved forward with some minimal sense of urgency to implement the proscribed reforms Kenya could be in a different situation today. For reasons that no one seems to have attempted to explain, however, the government sat on its hands until late last year as yet another election approached.', ""We now have an Inspector General appointed and confirmed finally, after the oversight panels were belatedly constituted. Thus, finally the senior leadership to implement the planned reforms is in place and at some point in the future, if things are not disrupted by next month's election, there can be hope of substantive reform. "", ""For anyone that doesn't fear the role of the Kenya's domestic security forces in the meantime, including in regard to the new election and the politicians, please look around Kenya, to the Tana River Delta, to Garissa, to Baragoi, and to gang-infested cities and towns in whatever region."", ""Read the report from Amnesty International dated January 30 entitled Kenya Police Reform: A Drop in the Ocean. Read the report released by Human Rights Watch on February 8 entitled High Stakes: Political Violence and Kenya's 2013 Elections. "", 'These organisations dispatched professional researchers to conduct interviews on the ground at higher and lower levels throughout the country to report on the reality of security conditions without political spin or the bland dismissive reassurance of government spokesmen and bureaucrats.', 'Part of what is so disappointing about the pace of progress in police reform is that it has so much impact on the lives of ordinary Kenyans. Unlike electoral commissions that play a specific role on a periodic basis, the difference between good policing, bad policing or no policing is a key determinant of the quality of life for Kenyans and the failure of the political class to act with alacrity in this area says a great deal about where their priorities lie in spite of the opportunity to learn hard lessons from 2007-08.', 'I will say that I am concerned for the new Inspector General David Kimaiyo, specifically. He seems to be professional and he has long experience. I was especially intrigued to read about him in the report of the Parliamentary committee that investigated the Artur Brothers fiasco in 2006. ', 'As a senior police official at that time, he was one of those witnesses who was initially obstructed from testifying by those in power in spite of being subpoenaed, but his testimony was eventually secured. ', 'It is good to know that some people were at least afraid of what he would say. Nonetheless, he is in a new position set down on top of an old and dysfunctional organisation that he has inherited and that he does not have time to change before the election. ', 'The news already reports a rift over appointment authority between Kimaiyo and the chair of the new National Police Service Commissionthe kind of kinks in a new system that should be expected and that inevitably take time.', ""Ultimately, Kimaiyo even on paper, is only one member of the National Security Council. Even though he has some additional theoretical authority, he is to implement rather than set the government's security policy. "", 'Like Samuel Kivuitu in the weeks before the election in 2007, he has respect and credibility from his past, but he is one man only, one vote on security policy, and not fully in control of what will happen even within the police service at this point. This should be a sobering thought in light of what we all saw play out in the last election.', '\n']"

That 43 per cent Mutahi Ngunyi speaks of may actually represent the best that Uhuru can hope for.', ' ', 'Nothing has provoked as much controversy in this election cycle, as the narrative about a tyranny of numbers put out by the veteran political commentator Mutahi Ngunyi a few weeks ago.', 'The basic points of this narrative are as follows: historically, Kenyans always vote on a clear tribal pattern, irrespective of what the issues are in any election. As such if you look at the combinations of key tribal leaders who have agreed to work together in a political coalition, you can more or less ascertain how many votes each coalition will get.', 'Arising from this comes two key points: that (as one source puts it) Jubilee Coalition and Its Tyranny of Numbers: if history is a reliable reference point, we assume that the Gema and the Kalenjin nations will vote for this coalition as a bloc. If they do, the combined vote for this bloc is 6.2 Million or 43.2 per cent of the total vote according to the IEBC December 18 voter registration tallies.', 'This source adds that The CORD coalition is primarily composed of the Luo nation and 80% of the Kamba nation. The combined starting point for CORD coalition is 19.2 per cent or 2.74 million votes...arrived at this figure by adding the Prime Ministers ethnic support (Luo) and that of the Vice President (Kamba).', 'This, of course is what caused so much consternation among those who support the Cord and so much rejoicing among the supporters of the Jubilee Coalition.', 'By any standards, a political coalition starting off with 43 per cent of the total Kenyan vote locked up in its strongholds would be more or less invincible. Especially if the principal rival coalition has only 20 per cent roughly, as a starting point. Indeed Mr Ngunyi actually went so far  in his TV interview  as to call the presidential election in Jubilees favour, announcing that the outcome of this election had been predetermined at the voter registration exercise, and CORD was bound to lose.', ' ', 'RETURN OF THE SPECTRE OF MASSIVE RIGGING', 'This kind of wild generalisation would be merely amusing, for very many reasons, if not for the fact that it has brought back the spectre of massive rigging into the upcoming election.', 'When speaking in private, the hard core of Jubilee Coalition supporters  who base their expectations entirely on the tyranny of numbers theory  claim that they are sailing to victory with the greatest of ease. And that nothing short of phenomenal rigging could possibly deny Uhuru Kenyatta the presidency in the very first round of voting.', 'On the other hand, the partisans of Cord, are willing to come out quite openly to allege that the whole purpose of this deeply-flawed theory of the tyranny of numbers is to create the right psychological framework for massive rigging by Jubilee. And that the whole point of this theory being put out in the first place, is to provide a narrative which will be used to explain why and how Uhuru Kenyatta won  after he has been rigged in on March 4.', 'Thus, it is worth considering what merit, if any, this theory has, and whether it is in any way an accurate rendering of what we should expect in the elections.', ' ', 'COULD ALL THE POLLSTERS BE WRONG?', 'Perhaps the most effective refutation of the tyranny of numbers theory in the results of the recent opinion polls. Virtually all the reputable pollsters are unanimous in predicting, as of this point, a dead heat between the two leading presidential candidates, with the Cord candidate, Raila Odinga considered to have a slim lead.', 'In general, Uhuru Kenyatta is rated to have somewhere between 42 per cent and 44 per cent of the vote at this point in time, and Raila Odinga is rated at between 44 per cent and 46 per cent. Given the margin of error in such polls, this amounts to a situation in which either candidate could just as easily win.', 'Interestingly enough, this is more or less what the pollsters had as Kenya went into the 2007 general election: Raila had a slight lead over the incumbent, President Mwai Kibaki in that election, which was also generally judged to be too close to call.', 'To this, we may add the fact that Kenyan pollsters have accurately predicted the results of the 2002 presidential elections; the 2005 referendum; the 2007 presidential elections; and the 2010 referendum.', 'This is a track record of reliability which would be acceptable in any nation, and at any time since the advent of opinion polling.', 'So, the first question which could be posed to those who uncritically accept the theory of the tyranny of numbers is, If Raila Odinga starts off with only 20 per cent of the vote, then where does he get the additional 25 per cent of the vote that pollsters are predicting he will get?', ""Or put another way, since Uhuru Kenyattas supposed tyranny of numbers only amounts to 43 per cent - the same percentage of support that the pollsters give him  does this mean that only the Gema and the Kalenjin will vote for Uhuru, while almost everyone else will vote for Raila? Are we facing the spectre of a clear voting pattern of '40-against-2'?"", ' ', ""ENTER 'THE BRADLEY EFFECT'"", 'Oddly enough, there is nothing unusual about people saying to pollsters that they will vote for one candidate, and then turning round and voting for the rival candidate. It is actually quite common in an election where deep (but often unspoken) racial or communal rivalries exist, which is considered to be politically incorrect to discuss openly.', 'In the US, this is known as the Bradley Effect among political scientists as much as newspaper columnists.', 'In a 2012 article in The Daily Caller, political columnist Mickey Kaus explained, The Bradley Rule holds that voters will be reluctant to tell pollsters they are voting against an African-American for fear of being labelled racist. It allegedly hurt Tom Bradley in 1982 and Douglas Wilder in 1989.', 'Indeed, thanks to what happened to Doug Wilder (i.e. he too seemed to lead in the polls, but ended up losing) this phenomenon is sometimes called the Wilder Effect too. And it is always a consideration when there is a black candidate on the ballot, for a significant political office like governor or senator.', 'The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof noted in 2008, for example, that Democrats are wringing their hands in nervousness over the Bradley Effect, in which black candidates poll well but win fewer votes than expected. Thats usually attributed to voters lying about racism  telling pollsters theyre going to vote for a black when they actually plan to vote for a white  but some scholars believe it has less to do with lying than with unconscious racism that leaves voters with growing doubts that lead to a last-minute mind change in the voting booth. In any case, though, the Bradley Effect has been diminishing in recent years, and in many races disappeared.', ' ', 'WHAT DID MUTAHI NGUNYI MISS?', 'In the Kenyan context, what we are faced with at this time is not an election result which paints a completely different picture from that which the polls had led us to expect. Rather, it is a conflict between two narratives, based on more or less the same voter registration figures.', 'Nobody seriously doubts that the great majority of Kenyan voters tend to go along with a clear tribal preference, when it comes to presidential elections. So Mr Ngunyis point of departure  that the Kalenjin and the GEMA nations together amount to a huge basket of votes, is not in doubt.', 'The unanswered question though, is what has Mutahi Ngunyi missed? For if his projections were accurate, then there should be no question of a dead heat between Uhuru and Raila. It should have been equally obvious in the opinion polls, that Uhuru had a huge (though by no means insurmountable) lead. Or at the very least, the numbers given by the leading pollsters should vary so widely as to create serious doubts about their credibility.', 'One pollster may be wrong; but they cannot all be wrong. So how do you reconcile the pollsters being unanimous that this election is a dead heat, while Mutahi Ngunyis theory  and a very influential theory it is  argues that Uhuru Kenyatta has such a huge lead, that Raila cannot hope to catch him?', 'Just as the Amercian political scientists turned to psychology to explain what they thereafter termed as the Bradley Effect so too, must we now turn to psychology to explain this divergence between the two sets of statistics: Mutahi Ngunyis reliance on the registration numbers from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to project an unassailable lead for Uhuru Kenyatta; and the combined results of the reputable Kenyan pollsters, which suggest that either Uhuru or Raila could just as easily win, with Raila  at this point  having a slightly better chance of winning.', ' ', 'A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF THE IEBC NUMBERS', 'But before we even consider the psychological factors, we should note that the tyranny of numbers theory is based on just 62.4 per cent of the vote. That alone makes it suspect. If this theory were to be taken seriously as in any way reflecting final outcomes, it should at least have accounted for some 95 per cent of the vote, thus giving some indication as to why one candidate had effectively won already; and the other was doomed to fail.', 'In this case, there is a clear 37.6 per cent which is not accounted for. This is far too large a number to be referred to as a swing vote. The swing vote factor only comes in, when some 90 per cent or more of the vote has been accounted for.', 'Using yet another American example, here is an analysis published in 2001, in the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, and written by Jeffrey Helmreich. It is titled The Israel swing factor: how the American Jewish vote influences US elections and it made this argument:', 'There are two clashing myths on the political power of American Jewry. One claims that the community is too small to affect national elections; Jews make up less than three per cent of the US population. A contrasting view holds that US Jews play a disproportionately large role in national politics thanks to their campaign donations and media influence.', 'According to evidence confirmed in the most recent elections (2000) however, American Jewish voters maintain the potential to be the decisive factor in national election results. Yet, this ability does not emanate from any financial or public relations clout, which is overestimated. Rather, American Jews wield power through their high concentration in key states, and their tendency to behave as a swing vote in ways that set them apart from virtually all other groups in American politics.', 'So if a population as small as three per cent counts as a decisive swing vote in close elections, then how can any calculation that leaves out a clear 37 per cent of the vote  and confidently predicts a precise outcome from this calculation  possibly be taken seriously?', 'A different interpretation of the IEBC registration numbers then  when reconciled with the results of the opinion polls  may well be that most of the country is united against the Gema-Kalenjin political coalition that goes by the name Jubilee.', 'And that perhaps a significant number of Kalenjin and Gema community members, have also decided to vote against their tribal wave and support Raila Odinga instead. And that this claim of a solid 43 per cent of the vote having been locked in by the Jubilee coalition is a hoax, which will be exposed when the final tally is made.', ' ', 'A MATTER OF PSYCHOLOGY', 'There could be any number of reasons why the rest of the country might unite against Jubilee: it could be a growing awareness that the Jubilee candidates for president and deputy president will not be here to preside over anything if they should win; that they will have their hands full defending themselves at The Hague.', 'It could be a fear of economic sanctions, if the two refuse to obey the summons from The Hague.', 'It could be a simple sense of resentment that only those two communities  the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin  have ever had one of their own occupy State House, and so someone from some other tribe should now have an opportunity to lead the nation.', 'Or it could be that  contrary to appearances on the surface  there are many within the Kalenjin community who are not yet reconciled to voting for a Kikuyu presidential candidate, given the extreme bad blood between the two communities as revealed in the 2008 post-election violence.', 'It could be that when William Ruto gave up his own presidential ambitions to support Uhuru Kenyatta as his running-mate, he did not really take the entire Kalenjin vote with him, into the Jubilee coalition, much as the DPM Musalia Mudavadi evidently did not carry all of Western Kenya with him into the Amani Coalition.', 'This, of course, is what would be a classic example of the psychological phenomenon defined as the Bradley Effect: that the Kalenjin voters may currently appear to be reconciled to voting in a Kikuyu president; but then when they get to the ballot box, we will find that  owing to unresolved historical differences  they are, ultimately, not willing to do so.', 'In short, it may well be that the true tyranny of numbers"" will be expressed in a 57 per cent vote against Uhuru in the widely-anticipated runoff between him and Raila; that although he is a strong candidate with massive grassroots support in Central Kenya, Uhuru Kenyatta will lose solely because it goes against the national sentiment to have a Kikuyu succeeding another Kikuyu to the presidency.', 'And it is to be noted that such a perspective does not argue that Mutahi Ngunyi cooked up those numbers from the IEBC. Those numbers  on the face of it  appear to be real enough. What is however revealed, is that Ngunyi had no real idea what those numbers signified; and that he lacked the sophistication to go beyond a simple tribal calculus, which in any case he based on less than 65 per cent of the total vote.', ' ', 'AN EMPTY HOAX', 'We can conclude then, that the tyranny of numbers narrative is little more than an empty hoax. The alleged starting point of the Jubilee Coalition is basically just the 43 per cent that all the polls estimate Uhuru Kenyatta will get. And the only tyranny possible, is that the rest of the Kenyan voters will unite to deny Uhuru victory in the second round of balloting.', 'The projection that Uhuru starts off with a huge numerical advantage is pure myth. That 43 per cent may actually represent the best that he can hope for. It is an end game number, not a starting point. And unless all the pollsters are wrong  despite having been right for the last five electoral events in Kenya  this presidential election is going into a runoff which distinctly favours Raila Odinga as the eventual winner ', '\n']"

My contention is that the best debater is not always the best leader.', 'To that extent, facilitators of the big debate have a misdemeanor to respond to. The best leaders world over distinguish themselves through character, consistency in pursuing moral threads in their politics and moral courage.', 'This is demonstrable. While the Biblical Moses easily stood out as charismatic in view of his history as a rebel to the pharaoh, a survivor in adversity and a messenger of God, being a stammerer, he would have fared miserably in a debate with his more articulate brother, Aaron. Moses relied on Aaron to address crowds due to this inadequacy.', 'The intellectual atmosphere engineered by the facilitators during the Monday presidential debate was substantially status quo fully fitted with cushions for those with moral leadership queries. Im referring to the facilitators glaring gaps in the choice of questions seemingly designed to save the faces of some candidates.', 'That aside, a number of other questions crossed my mind. I asked how possible it was for the facilitators to appreciate the historical achievement that the debate represented without giving the candidates a chance to state their individual input and sacrifice in the realisation of the same. Is it because Raila will be unmatched?', 'How can, for instance, Nelson Mandela hold a similar debate with presidential candidates from the Racist Boers (National Party) and a question on his special role in the liberation of South Africa does not feature?', 'Giving the debaters opportunity to tell Kenyans about their role in creating conducive space for such debates would have given people the chance to identify who among the candidates has the strengths of the inarticulate Biblical Moses compared to the sleek tongue of his inexperienced and not-so-tested younger brother, Aaron.', 'If this was the starting point for the debate, it would have separated job/fortune seekers, adventurers and those committed to a cause of service to society.', 'Dida, the impressive teacher would have nothing to say because despite being an adult, he has never featured anywhere at the nations moments of need. The fairly articulate man of attitude and authority Peter Kenneth, and Uhuru Kenyatta, the ultimate symbol of conservatism in Kenya, would have been humbled by their inability to present a single act of sacrifice in their entire history.', 'The facilitators were creatures of the status quo-yes, the one that keeps resisting reforms. What would have been wrong by beginning the debate by observing a minute of silence in memory of those who died struggling to create that occasion?', 'Julie Gichuru and Linus Kaikai may have drunk Mois milk (read young), but surely they are educated enough to know that Bishop Timothy Njoya, Gitobu Imanyara, John Khaminwa, Kepta Ombati (whose leg was broken by the GSU in reform campaigns in 1997) and the abandoned families of freedom fighters were watching the debate.', 'What harm is there in recognising that the debate is not manna from heaven but an expensive architectural design of men and women, majority of whom were not even literate while fighting for the realisation of this democratic goody?', 'As expected, all the candidates in different words projected themselves as social democrats through their social welfare agenda. Conservative capitalists know it is politically incorrect to proclaim themselves conservative or mere agents of international capital so they often package themselves as free market believers or social democrats.', 'It is amazing that while Raila Odinga was challenged to state his ideology (social democracy), Uhuru Kenyatta, the embodiment of ultra-capitalism, was left scot-free. Martha Karua cited Cuba, a communist country, to illustrate the viability of her version of social democracy but no facilitator pinned her down to that.', 'Had Raila cited socialist countries to strengthen his people first politics in the debate, I suspect the youthful facilitators would have accused him of being a communist.', 'The facilitators promised to bring the elephant into the room but I believe time and prejudice allowed in too small a fraction of it in. In the course of the interview, an ethnic pattern emerged on the ICC question which the facilitators consciously ignored.', 'I wonder how the debate on the ICC was concluded without asking Uhuru if he still maintains that Raila engineered their trip to The Hague.', 'About friendship between the two? The facilitators did not bother to interrogate further the claim by Uhuru to be friendly to Raila yet he is on record saying on national television that he has no problem with Luos except Raila who he described in his mother tongue as Kimundu.', 'While the spirit that drove the debate seems to be inculcating a culture of accommodation and tolerance for deviant views, it is clear that our first presidential debate failed to dig out critical leadership capacities because it allowed status quo presidential candidates to get away with historical baggage.

Only Kanu's voice was heard in Parliament and it\ndutifully passed anything that Kanu president and government wanted.\nThese are the times to which some leaders are asking Kenyans to go back\nto. "", 'To ensure people wore the Kanu suit only, however dirty\nor tattered, all parties except Kanu were banned, forcing people to\nelect Kanu leaders only.', ' ', 'After banning other parties,\npeople could only vote for a Kanu suit of leadership whether they liked\nit or not. Rebels against Kanu suit were always taught a lesson by\nbeing cast into detention without trial to languish there for many\nyears. They were also banned from employment, farming and business. The\nmost unlucky were arrested, tortured and killed for opposing the Kanu\nsuit.', ' ', 'Kenyans were also forced to vote for certain Kanu\nleaders only. To ensure this, secret ballot was quashed and replaced\nwith open queue voting whose purpose was to intimidate voters to vote\nfor Kanu government favourites only. Any voter who dared queue behind a\ndissident or rebel would identify themselves for punishment as would\nany rebel candidate who offered to challenge a Kanu presidents\nfavourite.', ' ', 'Even then, when the rebel won, he was declared\nloser, as government losers were declared winners, a practice that was\nrecently witnessed in party primaries.', ' ', 'Suit voting is\nnot new in Kenya.

Given Kenyans rejection of its dictatorship, it\nbaffles that some leaders are fighting for its restoration and use.\nConveniently, these leaders have forgotten that the disease that\nre-occurs is the one that kills and it is foolish to return a finger\nwhere it was once bitten. Strangely, suit voting is justified with\npropaganda of ethnic salvation.', ' ', 'Not to be naked after\nrejecting the Kanu suit, people also struggled for multiparty democracy\nthat was restored in 1992. Since, Kanu suit was no more legally\nenforced and Kenyans were free to pick, mix and wear outfits that were\noften smarter than Kanus tattered suit.', ' ', 'Despite this\nfreedom, there were leaders who sought to make Kenyans wear suits other\nthan that of Kanu.

Thankfully, during the party nominations, we saw party\nelectorates bravely reject imposition of leaders from above in whatever\nname.

From this, one hopes the\nKenyan Spring is just around the corner.', ' ', 'Suit voting is\nslavery that Kenyans seeking good leadership should avoid and reject\nlike leprosy. Just because party leaders prefer so, people should not\nelect candidates over whom they have not been consulted and are known\nto be thieves, crooks, clowns or useless.

Other variables like level of education, gender and age can change voting dynamics. He says this is why pollsters publish the demographics they work with.', ""Ngunyi's Tyranny of Numbers did not have any reasonable demographics according to Handa. Besides, Handa says there are other ethnic blocs apart from the ones Ngunyi lumped together which will participate in the polls. He says in a democracy the principle of universal suffrage, one man one vote is key."", 'It did not have any demographics. It was based on one assumption that Kenya is made up of certain ethnic blocs which vote in certain ways, that assumption is wrong.', 'According to him, only a scientific poll can accurately predict results of an election that has not yet been held. He says by and large, scientific polls are credible to the extent in which they remain objective and in which they adhere to minimum research standards.', 'Any body set about to do serious research who gets the correct sample size, distributes it appropriately, frames questions properly and does proper data analysis will get results close as possible to what voters will actually vote.', 'Asked about lack of credibility arising from pollsters use of census results as opposed to voters register demographics, Handa concedes that ideally, the frame ought to be registered voters. He however says in the absence of updated voters register, the next available frame would be the population census because it shows the proportion of Kenyans who are 18 and above.', 'And its a close, good indication of voter figures. That is why IEBC uses the population census to estimate the number of people who should be registered in particular regions. We may not have the updated voter demographics but we know we have 14 million voters and we know where they are, he said.', 'He said although opinion polls have chances of biases here and there, this is catered for in the margin or error calculation. The margin of error is calculated on the basis of possibilities of questions not being framed properly, missing data and the way questions are put among others.', 'Asked to give tyranny of numbers a margin of error, Handa said: There is nothing like margin of error in that thing. That thing was not scientific. Even historically speaking I think it was wrong. He has not even come out to defend it.', 'Wolf who is traditionally associated with Ipsos Synovate group is opposed to tyranny of numbers right from its framing. He says tyranny suggests somebody is being oppressed and yet in a democracy numbers, any numbers or even a number matter.', 'For him the correct phrases to use is safety of numbers or importance of numbers.', 'Yes it is true certain ethnic groups are larger than others and therefore candidates from those groups may have some advantage than others. Fortunately, there is no single ethnic group in Kenya that approaches a quarter of the population, he says.', 'On this basis, Kenya would never suffer the tragedy of Rwanda- polarisation of two large groups. The safety of the Kenyan numbers is that no ethnic group on its own can ever aspire through the vote to achieve dominance.', ""Wolf also challenges Ngunyi's assumption that certain communities would vote for their presidential candidates man-to-man and woman-to-woman."", ""We know from our survey data that there is no ethnic group in this country which is 100 per cent united behind their candidates. Within every ethnic group there are free thinkers, deviants and independent minds. It's false and misleading to make such a blanket assumption, he says."", 'He says the best example is UDF presidential candidate Musalia Mudavadi. Three opinion polls have in the recent past showed that he is not the leading presidential candidate in Western and in his Luhya tribe.', 'And so for him, scientific polls are the only credible means of crunching numbers. He admits that polls have statistical margin of error. He said there are also other issues such as excluding non English and non-Swahili speakers from the polls with the risk of creating a bias.', 'There are also other issues like respondents lying. The main weakness for voter intention surveys is voter turn out, he says. Although its very rare that voter turn out is rarely likely to go below 65 per cent and beyond 75 per cent, poll results reflect an extraordinarily higher results than this.', 'According to Wolf, the past record of pollsters in the country however bails pollsters out of these credibility issues.', 'Going back to 1997 election, the only company that was polling, Strategic PR, got it basically right that Moi would be re-elected but with a smaller margin than 1992. They were outside margin of error but not by much, he says.', 'He says ever since and starting in 2002 elections when many pollsters joined the business of polling, all the pollsters always got it right but sometimes with minimal deviations from the margins of error.', 'Wolf is also ready to concede on one thing; that pollsters are challenged by closely called polls. No pollster can predict the results in a very closely called election because candidates can be defeated by 1 vote or even 100 votes.', 'The closer the election, the more likely it is that pollsters cannot produce any prediction. And they should say so. I was widely quoted in the last election saying it was too close to call. And up to now, no one know who won that election.', 'He say the real safety of numbers is in many pollsters doing the same thing so that comparisons can be made across them. He says this should and include the possibility of doing a poll of polls.', ""Like Handa, Wolf cannot give any margin of error to Ngunyi's figures because there was no sample used. He says Ngunyi did not even check past voting trends in each tribal bloc."", 'So yes, lets look at the importance of numbers but lets not worship them and give them an importance that goes beyond their meaning at least as shown in an empirical research, he says, signing off.', '\n']"

And in that reckoning, it is down to meanings.', 'In his statement on Kenyas elections, President Obama said, The United States does not endorse any candidate for office, but we do support an election that is peaceful and reflects the will of the people.', 'That is clear enough. The US supports an election that reflects the will of the people.', 'But then comes along Johnnie Carson, the US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs with his clarification. He says, People should be thoughtful about those they choose to be leaders, the impact their choices would have on their country, region or global community. Choices have consequences."" Again, clear enough. Or is it?', 'Kenyans are familiar with the Swahili saying mtoto akililia wembe, mpe. (If a child cries for a razor, give.) That seemed to be what Johnnie Carson was saying. Did he contradict President Obamas assertion that the US will support a peaceful outcome that reflects the will of the people? Can you support and punish at the same time? ', 'The US would probably answer in the affirmative, arguing that support for the outcome of the election does not negate US policy governing engagement with individuals facing crimes against humanity.', ""But these leaves many questions on the nature of consequences unanswered. Consider the statement by the British High Commissioner. He said, It is well known the position of my government and others is that we don't get in contact with the ICC indictees unless it is essential. "", 'What would be the consequences of a no-contact-unless essential"" policy? What constitutes essential contact? Does no contact translate into sanctions? If yes, would these be targeted at the two individuals only? And is contact with senior government officials, including cabinet secretaries, allowed as long as it is not with the indictees?', 'Will the razor in the hands of the child be sharp or blunt? There is too much ambiguity. Ambiguity can be a useful diplomatic tool. But not in this case. The West is in a dilemma. ', 'It will be in greater dilemma if, having been elected in a free and fair manner, Uhuru and Ruto decide to cooperate with the ICC. The presumption of innocence (until one is proven guilty) makes it morally tricky for the West to punish Kenya before the due process of law is concluded.', ""Meanwhile, besides turnout and mobilisation, the outcome of this election seems to hinge on the degree to which the Kalenjin vote will swing one side or the other. In all the 'numbers' permutations, the Jubilee coalition takes it if there is an overwhelming vote for Uhuru by the Kalenjin."", 'The Kalenjin vote is still in relative flux. The reason it has not solidified is due to an intense debate in the community around two related issues: trust and influence in government. Who, between Uhuru and Raila, can be trusted to guarantee the community significant influence in government? (Sad, but this is the nature of ethnic politics in Kenya today).', 'Raila, they argue, has shown in word and deed that he cannot be trusted. They point to the eviction of (mostly Kalenjin) squatters from the Mau Forest, his unwillingness to fight for the release of Kalenjin youth who were arrested following the 2007/2008 violence, and his sacking of William Ruto. They say he has a propensity for playing to the international gallery and would not hesitate to ship Ruto to The Hague in order to burnish his statesman credentials.', 'Those opposed to Uhuru have equally serious issues with him and his community. They say Ruto is merely being used by Uhuru to ascend to power. They point to the dishonoured accord between Raila and Kibaki, and Kibaki and Kalonzo. ', 'More importantly, they say the hatred by Kikuyus towards Ruto for his (alleged) role in the 2007/2008 post-election violence has merely been shelved temporarily and will resurface the day after Uhuru is sworn in as President. ', 'They also point to recent murmurs of discontent from among those close to Uhuru, unhappy with Rutos ""oversize influence"" within the Jubilee coalition. Once Uhuru is sworn in, they see the gloves coming off and Ruto being thrown under the bus in short order. ', '(This, incidentally, provides Raila with a great strategy lever: nothing will swing the vote away from Uhuru more than credible evidence of Rutos mistreatment in Jubilee).', 'It is a quandary: between Raila and Uhuru, who will they trust more? This is the crucial question. How this question is resolved in the next two weeks could determine the winner of the presidential contest. And then the consequences or lack thereof will follow.', ' ', '\n']"

A dominant male chased a few possible contenders away while other males stood guarding the rest of the herd as tiny bambi-like lambs suckled on their mothers.', 'Then a trio of bambis stood innocently watching me as I took photographs of them. They were really inquisitive, wondering what was happening but for me, it was a truly wonderful scene to absorb. Our family has used the name bambi as a term for baby impala ever since I was a child.', 'For those who are unfamiliar with the term bambi, it comes from the 1942 American movie about a baby white-tailed deer. I guess the term just means little child in Italian, as a short version of bambino.', 'As I watched them, my real hope was that they would all survive and live their full lives as adult impala.', 'An interesting note is that impala are found over a large area over Southern and Eastern Africa. The early dutch settlers gave the name rooibok (redbuck) due to their deep rusty red appearance.', 'Even the city of Kampala is named after the impala from the phrase in Luganda ka-mpala meaning (place of the impala ). They are commonly preyed on by leopard, cheetah and at times the lion.', 'Their method of fleeing from predators is sometimes spectacular as they can leap as high as three metres and bound as far as ten metres with various jinking motions. I guess no antelope likes to be on the big cat menu.', 'Next time when visiting the park, it is worth sitting next to a herd and just watching events happen at natures pace.', 'The park is open daily from 6am to 7pm.

These are; their quest is not about democracy and neither is it about giving Kenyans a choice at the polls. Yet, the two have somewhat duped a lot of people into believing their quest is about democracy and giving Kenyans a choice at the polls.', 'Indeed, notwithstanding the serious crimes against humanity Uhuru faces, during the presidential debate, Uhuru likened what he faces to ordinary challenges Kenyans face on a day to day basis. He went further and said those who support him have already given him a pass on these serious charges, claiming they know all about the charges but still support him.', 'Uhuru confidently went on to surmise that if Kenyans elect him, they will have shown confidence that [he] will do the job. This assertion is wrong in several ways.', 'To begin with, what Uhuru faces are not ordinary challenges Kenyans experience on a day to day basis. To say the truth, Uhuru seems not to have taken the case he faces seriously.', 'This in turn helps explain the nonchalant and dismissive attitude displayed by Uhuru and Ruto whenever they discuss the ICC. They often dismiss the whole process as inconsequential while at times pretending to be ready to prove [their] innocence.', 'Uhuru and Ruto are charged with being responsible for the murder of more than 1,300 people in addition to rapes, maiming, destruction of property and displacement of more than 600,000 innocent Kenyans.', 'These are not ordinary challenges Kenyans face on a day to day basis. These are very serious criminal charges Uhuru and Ruto must take very seriously in defending rather than hedging their bets on winning the presidency and thereby defying the ICC. This will have dire consequences for the entire country.', 'Indeed, it is a fact that one facing charges involving murder would never ordinarily be free pending trial, yet the ICC gave Uhuru and Ruto special consideration in allowing them to remain free pending trial.', 'Instead of using this freedom to prepare for their cases, Uhuru and Ruto have instead opted to vie for the presidency and vice presidency as though these charges mean nothing to them.', 'That may be the case in their minds and those they have managed to pull wool over their heads but one would have to conclude a majority of those going to the polls on March 4, 2013 would have to disagree.', 'The duo is also disingenuous and, quite frankly, dishonest when they claim that their quest for the presidency is about democracy and giving people a choice at the polls,', 'This is about the two of them and an ambitious ploy to gain the presidency in the hope of either thwarting or altogether defying the ICC.', 'Their hiding behind democracy must be exposed.', 'The world is replete with examples of despotic dictators who often command 80-90 per cent of coerced votes cast yet they claim to be democratic. People like Saddam Hussain come to mind.', 'One of the reasons these despots succeed in coercing such massive numbers of votes is often because it doesnt take much convincing of their own tribes to vote for them, even as these very tribesmen and women know these are despots better suited for the hanging chambers for their crimes of genocide. But human nature being the way it is, tribalism tends to be more easily exploited than rejection of such exploitation.', 'It took the decisive force of the United States and other allies to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Saddams trial, conviction and hanging for the genocide of his people was perhaps the last writing on the wall. As civilised nations, we cannot allow those suspected of committing such heinous crimes to do so at will and without accountability regardless of whether they find refuge in their clans or tribes.', 'The needs and rights of a nation are greater and far more outweigh the needs or rights of a single individual.', 'The fact is, much as Saddam Husseins tribe supported him even long after he was tried, convicted and hanged, for committing genocide, much the same way you can expect anyone charged at the ICC for genocide to count on their tribe no matter what the evidence or outcome.', 'Thats just a fact of life.', 'However, it is unacceptable to turn around and point to that virtually guaranteed support and say, to hell with justice and post-election violence victims.', 'If Uhuru and Ruto are elected, it would be virtually on account of a majority of two tribes coming together and massively voting for them. But unlike in the past where this has happened whether people like it or not and without any consequences save for post-election violence, the consequences of electing ICC indictees will be dire. It behooves every voter, especially those sitting on the fence to think very seriously and do the necessary to avoid such an eventuality.', 'Just as its not about democracy for Uhuru and Ruto to be on the ballot, its not true as Uhuru claimed during the debate that by electing him, Kenyans would have passed a vote of confidence that he can do the job.', 'As noted above, people often support their own leaders regardless of what they have done simply because they are their own. It amounts to selfishness to exploit this human weakness to seek high office.', 'Uhuru can do the right thing and step-aside rather than selfishly pursue the presidency. Meanwhile the majority of Kenyans going to polls on March 4 should show the rest of the world that Kenyans know better than to put themselves in such a precarious position.', '\n']"
