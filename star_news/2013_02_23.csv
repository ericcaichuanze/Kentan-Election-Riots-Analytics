Is this school an entity independent of Moi or not? posed Justices David Maraga, Daniel Musinga and Fatuma Sichale.', 'In that uncertainty a substantial miscarriage of justice may have occurred or is likely to occur if the applicants are not granted leave to pursue the intended appeal to the Supreme Court, the judges added.', 'The judges said some issues touching on agricultural land need to be clarified for the general good of the country.

Nothing has changed. Kenyatta is still an ICC indictee (not a suspect, but an indictee, someone against whom what judges consider credible evidence has been laid, which is much more serious).', 'Five years ago, as the 2007 election approached, something strange began to happen in the opinion polls conducted by several local polling firms.', 'A year earlier, on December 23, 2006, a public opinion poll conducted by the then Steadman Group had put Kibaki in the lead in popularity in all provinces except Nyanza. ', 'Overall, he had a 42 per cent approval rating, with Musyoka in second position at 20 per cent and Raila Odinga in third place with 14 per cent.', 'Over the succeeding year, this picture changed gradually but very decisively, always in the same direction  Kibaki and Musyoka gradually losing support, Odinga gradually gaining.', 'In September 2007, when Steadman announced the results for its latest monthly poll, Odinga had finally taken the lead, with 47 per cent to Kibakis 38 per cent and Musyokas eight per cent.', 'Government supporters now came out to criticise the polls  something they had not done when Kibaki was leading. Even if Raila is leading, we are not worried, said roads minister Simeon Nyachae.', 'Steadman is a businessman and he is just making money. Weekly polls by three pollsters were then commissioned by the Daily Nation.', 'The first results, published simultaneously the following week, on October 7, put Odinga at 46, 46, and 49.6 per cent, with Kibaki at 35, 41 and 39.6 per cent respectively.', '(As an interesting aside, Kanu, the monolithic monster people had fought so hard to tame for so many decades, now trailed in the polls with a tiny one per cent rating. It was a situation that would have been unimaginable less than 10 years earlier.)\\', 'The next Steadman poll, published on October 13, just after Kibakis launch of his presidential campaign, gave Odinga a 53 per cent approval rating to Kibakis 37 and Musyokas eight. ', 'PNU was quick to dismiss the poll as sheer propaganda, accusing Steadman of working for ODM and the US government. Polls by Infotrak Harris and Strategic Research confirmed Odingas widening lead.', 'Only a poll by the little-known Consumer Insight seemed out of sync with the others, giving Odinga 44 per cent to Kibakis 41. It was the beginning.', 'Another round of polls published on November 4 showed Odinga leading 50 to Kibakis 35 (Strategic), and 51.3 to Kibakis 32.2 (Infotrak Harris).', 'Once again, Consumer Insight was out of sync with the others, at 41 per cent for Odinga and 40.6 per cent for Kibaki. The degree of its variation from the other polls began to raise questions.', 'The next Infotrak Harris poll a week later gave Odinga 50.2 per cent to Kibakis 31.8 per cent. But the Steadman poll conducted at the same time showed a narrowing of the gap  45 per cent for Odinga and 41 per cent for Kibaki, with Musyoka up to 11 per cent.', 'Six days later, a Consumer Insight poll gave Odinga 40.7 per cent to Kibakis 41.4. It was the first time in eight weeks that any poll had rated Kibaki higher than Odinga.', 'By the following week, all the polls showed a marked narrowing of the gap between Kibaki and Odinga, at (Odinga figures first) 43.2/38.4 (Strategic), 39.5/40.4 (Consumer Insight), and 43.9/ 38.4 (Infrotrak Harris).', 'On December 7, Infotrak Harris published the results of a poll that showed 52 per cent of voters thought the election results would be rigged.', 'They were right. There was no reason why Kibakis stock should have risen so suddenly. Nothing had happened to make Kenyans spontaneously grow more in favour of Kibaki by a significant percentage.', 'Ratings do not change just like that, for no good reason. In the same way this year, 2013, there is no reason why Uhuru Kenyattas stock should suddenly have risen the way it has.', 'Nothing has changed. Kenyatta is still an ICC indictee (not a suspect, but an indictee, someone against whom what judges consider credible evidence has been laid, which is much more serious).', 'Of course, it is well-known that Kenyatta is pouring billions into his campaign  the kind of billions that no other candidate can come close to matching.', 'Less well-known to most people is that a prominent Kenyan (I have withheld his name) has privately admitted being the conduit for large sums of money that were paid to pollsters in 2007 to raise Kibakis profile.', 'This year, it would appear that there is a much more complex plot afoot, and we are seeing just the tip of this particular iceberg. Let us begin with purpoted political scientist Mutahi Ngunyis so-called analysis of purported voting patterns a few weeks ago, which skewed figures massively in favour of Kenyatta and for a few days caused a sensation  as well as alarm and despondency in some quarters.', 'That was what it was supposed to do, and it was a good piece of propaganda  you have to give Ngunyi that. It fitted seamlessly with William Rutos repeated assertion after the launch of Jubilees manifesto that We have the numbers.', 'In fact, this was virtually all Ruto had to say to every newscaster who interviewed him at KICC on that day. There was nothing like, We have the policies or We have the programmes.', 'No. Just  jubilantly  We have the numbers. It sounded alarm bells. Especially because Jubilee does not have the numbers. Ngunyis purported analysis of the numbers was itself analysed at length by this newspaper in last weeks Siasa section, which asked, Was Ngunyis purported analysis just a hoax?', 'I believe it was. Ngunyis half-baked figures and selective data do not stand up to scrutiny. Most notably, he completely ignored all the regions of the country where the coming election will be won and lost.', 'For me, it continues to be astonishing that TV stations and others persist in putting Ngunyi in the spotlight as some kind of expert  when all his predictions as far as I can remember have been spectacularly wrong.', 'His services as a columnist, making very wild and garbled assertions, have also twice been discontinued at another newspaper (whether by him or by the newspaper I dont know).', 'The articles he wrote were characterised by a variety of analogies through which Ngunyi attempted to explain what he purported to present as the vice in the country  the articles themselves finally metamorphosing into incomprehensible nonsense.', 'Ngunyi in fact has a very chequered history. Just before the 2007 elections, when Ngunyi was working for President Mwai Kibaki, he was named as the author of a report entitled Anglo Leasing: Some Thoughts, a brutal document advising the president to criminalise whistleblower John Githongos release of the dossier on the huge Anglo-Leasing corruption scandal.', 'The aim was clearly to silence Githongo and to wipe details of the scam from Kenyan collective memory, as well as to ensure there was no Anglo-Leasing-related loss of votes for Kibaki.', 'Ngunyi denied being the author of the document, as reported in the Standard newspaper of January 28th 2006, but suspicions persisted.', 'The documents author had demanded shs.2.2 million for consultancy services to counter Githongos damaging information. Ngunyi had reasons for revenge on Githongo.', 'In 2001, Ngunyi was sued for allegedly embezzling more than shs.10 million shillings, awarded some time in the 1990s by the Ford Foundation to an NGO called Series on Alternative Research in East Africa Trust (Sareat), of which Ngunyi was a director.', 'Ngunyi was sued alongside Zimbabwean minister Professor Jonathan Moyo, who was working as a Ford Foundation programme officer at the time the money allegedly disappeared.', 'Moyo is also a purported political scientist  one who switched from being a sharp critic of President Robert Mugabes government to being his chief propagandist and, according to various Zimbabwean publications, was a major player in Zimbabwes crackdown on journalists, the judiciary and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change of (now prime minister) Morgan Tsvangirai.', 'There are many guns for hire in Zimbabwe. Kenya is no different. In 1998, Ngunyis NGO had engaged Githongo to edit a regional political economy magazine called East African Alternatives.', 'According to reports, the magazine folded after four issues, and its closure was as a result of audit queries made by PriceWaterhouseCooper.', 'This led to the suit against Ngunyi by the Ford Foundation. And the Foundations star witness for the prosecution was to be none other than John Githongo.', 'The case was apparently later withdrawn, after Sareat agreed to repay the funds in question  but not before Ngunyi had written to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) asking them to probe alleged forgery of documents and money laundering at the Ford Foundations East Africa and New York offices.', 'In another strange twist of events, Ngunyi also reportedly turned turtle and offered to act as a prosecution witness against Moyo. In the document Anglo Leasing: Some Thoughts, the author recommended that Githongo be repatriated from Britain, where he had sought asylum after releasing the Anglo-Leasing dossier, and that he be charged with high treason.', 'Githongo has arrogated himself a high moral ground, the document told Kibaki. He is telling the world that you are bad and he is good. You need to deflate him. You need to cast him as an over-enthusiastic officer with good intentions but completely naive.', 'But more fundamentally, you must criminalise what he is doing. The author warned that, without this kind of action, the government in the court of public opinion was guilty as charged.', 'The author continued, The President is implicated directly or otherwise as per the Githongo dossier. This is why we must interpret public anger as a indirect assault on the President, not the implicated ministers... we must not attempt to resolve this scam, not before the 2007 elections.', 'The document also advised the government to release the Goldenberg report in a mirror image tactic that would infuriate and confuse, and recommended that the government must not fire or suspend any implicated politicians.', 'They form a ring around the president, the document continued. To remove them is to expose Kibaki. They must therefore remain in place and take the blame while inside.', 'If you remove them, the public will inevitably go for the president, demanding his resignation as well. In his tyranny of numbers scenario a few weeks back, Ngunyi served up several estimates of Kenyan voter numbers, but provided no coherent logic or calculations to justify these numbers, making wild assertions arrived at by no known polling methodology.', 'And that brings us to the current opinion polls and their methodologies and curious anomalies. All the pollsters in the last poll published indicated that they did face-to-face interviews using a digital pad.', 'While a digital pad is convenient for the researcher, a process audit would find it hard to unearth instances where individual questionnaire entries had been altered.', 'A hard-copy questionnaire lends itself well to such an interrogation process. Another concern regarding face-to-face interviews is the place of interview. ', 'The pollsters claimed to have done interviews at households between February 13 and 15  Wednesday to Friday, all working days. Who would have been interviewed in these houses? Househelps?', 'Househelps have their valid opinions too, but such an information-gathering approach totally obviates the participation of those of working age,18 years and above, who happen to be the main body of voters and thus should be the target respondents for this kind of poll. ', 'Household face-to-face interviews would be appropriate for household consumer market research (Do you use Harpic? Omo?) but definitely not for this kind of political opinion polling.', 'A house-based poll also works against the main benefits of the random process. If the pollster knows your house, it means your stated political opinion can be traced back to you.', 'Since your political opinion can get you killed, evicted or isolated, imagine how a respondent in Bondo would feel about publicly professing support for Kenyatta, or one in Gatundu doing the same for Odinga.', 'A true random process leaves a respondent anonymous, while giving them an equal chance to participate. The process reportedly being used is not random.', 'More worrying is that, according to evidence leaking out of polling houses, and contrary to reports made to the public, there were actually no house-based face-to-face interviews.', 'Pollsters have instead reportedly been conducting phone interviews based on a frame of registered mobile-phone users. While this is convenient and significantly cheaper, it is scientifically lacking in the necessary discipline.', 'The sampling frame for political polling must be the national voters register. A database of mobile-phone users does not reveal such crucial demographics as the age of the respondent (to qualify them to vote), whether they are registered voters or in which voter region the phone-user resides.', 'Sample size distribution is done by regions  yet you cannot verify the regional location of a respondent in a mobile-phone interview. They could be anywhere.', 'In addition, mobile-phone accessibility in rural areas, where more than 60 per cent of registered voters reside, is unreliable at best, absent at worst.', 'And crucial is the fact that, not unlike house-based interviews, phone interviews do not support the random process. Even more worrying is the fact that any such non-random process is fraught with potential abuse.', 'Any pollster with a mind to do so can buy 1,000 mobile lines and distribute them to that number of persons, who then participate in the phone interviews.', 'There is no proof with this kind of non-random polling that this is not happening, and largely influencing responses. There are many other questions regarding sampling.', 'Opinion polling is about measuring differences, and thus analysis and presentation focus on measures of dispersion variance, range and percentile.', 'For this reason, concern is about factors that occasion difference in opinion. Such factors include age, gender, social class, education level and region.', 'The first four cannot be determined before the poll and are usually allowed to emerge naturally through the random process, but the overall required sampling frame is the national voter register, and the sample size distribution is according to the weight for each electoral area.', 'In the poll results released on February 18, pollsters Ipsos Synovate, Strategic and Infotrak claim to have employed the appropriate sampling factors, but the published results raise more questions than answers.', 'There was no firm attempt to distribute the sample on the basis of counties, the largest electoral boundary. Strategic gave a list of 32 out of the 47 counties where their research was allegedly conducted but not how the sample was distributed to those counties.', 'No intra-county sample size distribution is discussed by any of the pollsters. Nairobi, Rift Valley, Western and Central are significantly over-sampled by Strategic Africa, while Rift Valley and North Eastern are significantly under-sampled.', 'A closer look into the counties they reached reveals a significant bias towards Nyanza, Central, Western, Lower Eastern and North / Central Rift. The pollsters rationale is that they focused on the top 30 or so counties in terms of registered voters.', 'But the 32 counties sampled by Strategic Africa account for only 33.3 per cent of the registered voters. The other two pollsters samples also average less than 35 per cent.', 'The implication is that the rest of the counties that are allegedly insignificant account for nearly 65 per cent of the registered voters! The sampling distribution is clearly not representative.', 'This is of particular importance considering that this significant minority (actually, not the minority but the majority, and also the same persons who were ignored by Ngunyi in his lamentably inadequate  read deliberately abstruse and misleading  analysis) will form the deciding vote.', 'The counties sampled are traditional strongholds of the two main presidential candidates and tend to cancel each other out in terms of registered voters, thus explaining the tie purportedly captured by the pollsters.', 'Surely, any pollster worth his or her salt who professed to have polled a tie at 45 per cent  to which a candidate needs to add only six per cent to win  would consider a constituency of 65 per cent somewhat significant!', 'The numbers presented in the analysis tables thus appear to reveal a deficient weighting system. It gives a false picture. Ruto does not have the numbers he thinks he has.', 'It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that, overall, these polls are conducted to a methodological and presentation design aimed at confirming an election too close to call, which would justify demand for a run-off, or a particular desired result  to be achieved by hook or by crook. Shades of 2007.', 'Altogether, the methodology and resulting figures appear to make nonsense of the polls being bandied about, regardless of who might seem to be in the lead. The potential difference, however, appears to be largely in Odingas favour.', ' ', 'The writer is a freelance journalist.', ' ', '\n']"

', 'You can only forgive someone if they seek forgiveness, but nobody has even come to seek forgiveness. Theres been no progress at all.', 'Given the present background narrative of an electoral pact between the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin whose sheer force of numbers gives Deputy Prime Minister Uhuru Kenyatta a head start like no other candidates bar Prime Minister Raila Odingas, Wandias sentiments are a stark reminder of one of the deepest divides of Kenya politics.', 'But there are other complex narratives unfolding contemporaneously with Uhuru and running mate William Rutos bold gamble of uniting the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin vote blocs on one presidential ticket and which also apply to them.', 'For instance, there comes a point in the lives of all political leaders when they no longer know what their grassroots supporters want. This point can occur as early as mid-career or as late as the end of a decades long, life-long career.', 'It can also teach a versatile leader lessons that had better be rapidly internalised and acted upon. When it occurs, this point is both unexpected and unmistakable and leaves even the most cunning and sly of operatives  and his or her closest handlers and observers, both friend and foe  wondering whether they are still up to the task of digesting the fruit of intelligence.', 'Such a point occurred for Prime Minister Raila Odinga beginning with the all-party nominations of December 18, 2012, and culminating in his campaign tour of Luo Nyanza at the end of January 2013.', 'Lessons of the Homa Bay Uprising', 'The volcanic eruption of grassroots discontent that confronted Raila, rejecting his preferred candidates for a number of elective seats below the presidency, including relatives and close associates, was a sight to behold.', 'In Homa Bay, Raila sat dejectedly on the VIP dais as ministers, aides and bodyguards provided human shields from an enraged crowd ready to throw missiles. Sections of the media even hooted about a Homa Bay Uprising.', 'Given the fanatical Luo Nyanza support for Raila and the Odinga brand of politics generally, this eruption of the grassroots was indeed surprising. Their support for his presidential ambitions is implicit.', 'But the Luo grassroots will no longer be given authoritative direction from the top on how to vote for the five other elective offices on offer at the general election under the new rules in the constitution  governor, senator, MP, county rep and womens rep. They want these decisions to be their own.', 'Railas total control of the Luo vote in the decade, 1997-2007 is clearly a thing of the past and the loss of it has gathered momentum in the period since the last general election when he missed becoming President by a whisker.', 'It was a decade of carefully plotted progression, rising from a Mickey Mouse presidential candidature in December 1997 in which he had only the Luo vote to the Kibaki Tosha king-making of October-December 2002 that broke Kanus back to the four-million-plus vote challenger of December 2007.', 'In the violent aftermath of 2007, Raila rose to become only the second person to be Prime Minister of Kenya, after Mzee Jomo Kenyatta in 1963-64. Now, more than ever before, as far as Raila and his supporters are concerned, the only way to go is up.', 'All other leaders of ethnic vote blocs must have looked at Railas predicament and its timing and wondered about the state of mind of their own grassroots and what nasty surprises lurk there that could surface with the worst possible timing and impacts.', 'And nowhere is this question more moot in the run-up to March 4 than in the Jubilee Coalitions Deputy President candidate Rutos Rift Valley grassroots of Kalenjinland.', 'For the last couple of years, Rutos main political narrative has been to the effect that he is the engineer of one of the most remarkable political stratagems in the history of Kenyan electioneering  an unprecedented vote pact between the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin, two of the biggest blocs in the land and the only communities to have produced presidents of Kenya in the first 49 years of Independence.', 'Greatest gamble of Kenyan elections', 'Uhuru is the presidential contender of the Jubilee Coalition, which brings together his The National Alliance (TNA) and Rutos United Republican Party (URP), among others.', 'This is easily the greatest gamble of Kenyan electoral politics. However, while there is no doubt that Uhuru will inherit outgoing President Mwai Kibakis lock on the massive Kikuyu vote bloc, there is incipient debate about the extent of Rutos hold on the Kalenjin and the communitys political appetite for being instrumental in propelling a third Kikuyu to State House in quick succession to one who has just served 10 years there.', 'If the Uhuru-Ruto gamble works, then the two will have played for some of the highest and most extraordinary stakes and won really Big Time. Their victory would rewrite the electioneering formbook in Kenya for the next several presidential election cycles. ', 'And although they might face governance challenges never faced before by the presidency on account of their being crimes against humanity indictees at the International Criminal Court and an unhappy Nairobi-based Diplomatic Corps whose Western complement would pointedly sup with the opposition and give the presidency a wide berth, the success of their gamble would give both friend and foe some considerable pause.', 'However, if they lose by dint of Ruto no longer enjoying an influence over the Kalenjin vote such as the one he had in the 2005 national referendum on the constitution and the 2007 presidential election, and by dint also of superior strategy on Railas part, then there will still be a paradigm shift in Kenyan electioneering, but to the detriment of the leadership of the countrys biggest community  the Kikuyu elite. ', 'No group finds less use for being in opposition than the Kikuyu elite, which considers itself part and parcel of government and has a sense of entitlement regarding running Kenyan affairs like no other group within these borders.', 'If Raila wins, and he and his strategists have almost nil doubts that he will make it this time, it will be on account of three strategies borrowed from American politics  the Bradley Effect, the Southern Strategy and Dog-whistle politics electioneering.', 'The procedure effect of all three strategies employed at the same time is the encirclement, isolation and defeat of the nations most numerous single vote bloc  the Mt Kenya bloc fronted by the Kikuyu elite.', 'The Bradley Effect is a phenomenon of American politics first noted in 1982.', 'Global newsmagazine, Time, published an essay on October 17, 2008, just a couple of weeks to Barack Obamas first historic win in the US presidential election.', 'The essay, headlined A Brief history of the Bradley Effect stated, ""The theory holds that voters have a tendency to withhold their leanings from pollsters when they plan to vote for a white candidate instead of a black one.', 'In 1982, Tom Bradleythe African-American mayor of Los Angelesran for governor of California. On the eve of the election, polls anointed him a prohibitive favourite. ', 'But on election day, Bradley lost to his white opponent, Republican George Deukmejian. Some experts chalked up the skewed polling to skin colour.', 'Alex Altman, the Time magazine writer, was asking Americans whether Obama was headed straight for a Bradley Effect scenario that would see his lead in the opinion polls evaporate in the voting booth on Election Day.', 'But Obama went on and buried the Bradley Effect for good, not once but twice in a row. The decommissioning of the Bradley Effect in American electioneering will be one of Obamas greatest legacies.', 'Electoral theatres & players', 'However, the dynamics of the Bradley Effect remain active in other electoral theatres and among players other than Americans. The numbers narratives that the Kenyan electorate of almost 15 million voters is being confronted with by the two biggest contenders and the political coalitions that they head are replete with Bradley Factor potentialities.', 'The top two candidates have been anointed by their respective strategists and analysts and both are powerfully presented and projected as being well and truly poised for victory.', 'The Kenyan political divide presented by Raila and Uhuru may not be racial but it is tribalist, a sub-species of racialism, and as black and white, in terms of starkness of choice and worldview, as any deep divide among people anywhere else on the planet.', 'An Odinga versus Kenyatta electoral contest has always been the most polarising that a political divide could get in Kenya without degenerating into violence. Kenyans have a clear-cut choice indeed, come March 4.', ""While Raila has enjoyed a consistent lead in the opinion polls since the formation of the outgoing Grand Coalition Government, Uhuru has what one political analyst called 'the tyranny of numbers'."", 'His Jubilee Coalition appears to command two of the largest vote catchment areas, the Mt Kenya and Rift Valley blocs. The Jubilee coalitions voter heartlands registered the biggest numbers of voters, accounting for 43 per cent of the voters roll.', 'Pollster narrative has a history', 'Railas strategists point out that the opinion poll narrative has been around much longer than the tyranny-of-numbers narrative, is researched and evaluated by autonomous experts and that the pollsters have not given Kenyans bad data in the 21-year-long multiparty era, when they have called every presidential poll accurately.', 'Cord strategists also hold on tenaciously to the idea that the prospect of an outgoing Kikuyu president handing over to an incoming Kikuyu president is a spectacle that few Kenyans outside the Mt Kenya regions relish and they will therefore vote accordingly, including inside Rift Valley, whatever assurances Ruto and his URP stalwarts have given Uhuru.', 'And so there is growing certainty, inside the Odinga presidential campaign war-room, that even if every Kikuyu and Kalenjin who registered as a voter voted on March 4 for Uhuru and running mate William Ruto, accounting for fully 43 per cent of the voters roll, their man still has much of the 57 per cent of the other voters and in any case, all the round one winner needs is 50 per cent plus one.', 'The Bradley Effect Kenyan style is therefore not a matter of tainted polling data, where large segments of the electorate promise one thing but deliver another in the privacy of the secret ballot voting booth, but of the factor of the tyranny-of-numbers narrative.', 'If any pre-poll strategic lying and evasiveness has taken place it has taken place deep inside the Rift Valley. The coming together of the Kikuyu and the Kalenjin to propel a candidate to State House is not only unprecedented but untested, and CORD is hoping against hope that Jubilees Rift Valley vote suffers a total Bradley Effect on March 4.', 'Culmination of 10-year-long Southern Strategy', 'If this happens it will have achieved the ultimate aims of the PMs Southern Strategy, launched as long ago as the 2002 presidential race when Uhuru was one of the two main candidates and actually had the Kalenjin vote bloc locked up, courtesy of the then outgoing President Daniel arap Moi.', 'That year the Southern Strategy was not deployed against the Kikuyu community as a vote bloc, both main candidates being Kikuyu, with Kibaki getting the backing of the rest of the country and Uhuru the Kalenjin and part of the southern Kikuyuland vote.', 'Wikipedia defines The Southern Strategy as in American politics referring to the Republican Party strategy of gaining political support or winning elections in the Southern section of the country by appealing to racism against African Americans.', 'Wikipedia goes on: The strategy was first adopted under future Republican President Richard Nixon and Republican Senator Barry Goldwater in the late 1960s. The strategy was successful in many regards. It contributed to the electoral realignment of Southern states to the Republican Party, but at the expense of losing more than 90 per cent of black voters to the Democratic Party.', 'For Raila Odinga, the Southern Strategy has worked well across two consecutive presidential elections in Kenya, 2002 and 2007, with the latter bringing him closer to the presidency than any losing candidate in the history of Kenyan electioneering has ever been.', 'What will it do for him in combination with the Bradley Effect and the Dog-whistle politics factor?

What Sanctions?,www.the-star.co.ke › Siasa,"Feb. 23, 2013, 12:00 am","['The past few weeks and months have seen numerous headlines printed, both within Kenya and around the world, on the perceived risk of possible economic or diplomatic sanctions being levied against Kenya if Uhuru Kenyatta is elected President.', 'A plethora of news articles outlining vague, unspoken threats from the United States, Britain and other European Union countries have served to alarm our electorate and subvert what should be a Kenyan debate on policy in favour of fostering speculation on the opinions of international actors.', 'That we have lost sight of the real issues affecting our people is unfortunate, but since the discussion has turned to this issue, let us be clear: there is no credible threat of economic or diplomatic sanctions being placed on Kenya in the event that any of the candidates is elected to the Presidency.', 'The alleged threat of such sanctions is an invention of election campaigns that was, for awhile, also played up by some foreign governments in a seemingly eager attempt to influence voters.', 'But it is Kenyans who must make their own choices and select the path to their own destinies - and to do so they deserve accurate information.', 'When the governments of the U.S., Britain and the EU, among others, were pushed over the past two weeks to clarify their official positions on levying sanctions against Kenya, they distanced themselves from such suggestions.', 'When questioned last week about sanctions Lodewjik Briet, EU Ambassador and Head of the EU Delegation to Kenya, told the Kenyan media, The word sanctions has never been used by us. Why would there be sanctions?', 'In fact, not one foreign government has actually come out to threaten economic sanctions against a possible Kenyatta administration. And for very good reasons.', 'While some elements in the West may have wished to influence the Kenyan elections by issuing vague statements about only maintaining essential contact, with a future Kenyatta government, as the British have, such threats are entirely implausible.', 'Realistically, the international community cannot afford to place any kind of sanctions on Kenya. Countries such as Britain and the U.S. cannot reduce diplomatic relations with Kenya because it is the key regional partner in the Global War on Terror.', 'The fate of al-Shabaab racked Somalia and the stability of East Africa as a whole is of paramount strategic importance to the West and Kenya is in a unique position to help like no other regional government can.', 'The Kenyan government has lead the military campaign to drive al-Shabaab out of Mogadishu and as far back into Somalia as possible. It is our men who are currently fighting on the ground to secure the border and keep the Somali capital free of the Islamic militants.', 'With France battling al-Qaeda in the Maghreb and America and Britain fighting in the middle east, those countries are unprepared to commit troops on the ground in the Horn of Africa. Kenya is their best and only option in the region for military assistance.', 'The Jubilee Coalition has pledged to continue committing its troops to fight al-Shabaab in Somalia and to secure stability in the region. Therefore, in the case of Mr. Kenyatta being elected president, western governments - especially Britain and the U.S. - will not risk the future of their war on terror by destabilising their relationship with the Kenyan government.', 'In terms of economics and international trade, Britain, and its citizens, have too much invested in the Kenyan economy to impose serious sanctions and thereby damage their own economy.', 'A significant portion of the privately-held land in Kenya is still owned by British citizens who are involved in the tourism industry and produce coffee, tea and horticulture for export.', 'Kenya also remains one of the last of Britains former African colonies to still have a largely positive and close relationship with the former colonial power.', 'At a time when Kenyan trade and economic partnerships with China are growing faster than with Britain, the U.S. and Europe, the West cannot afford to lose more African ground to the East.', 'Economists and political scientists agree that sub-Saharan Africa is set to make massive economic advances in the next 20 years. Western countries will not risk the economic damage isolating Kenya by way of sanctions could cause themselves now and in the future.', 'Knowing this, a group of Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Charge daffaires from a group of countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, the U.S. and the EU wrote and signed an editorial that was printed in the Daily Nation on Wednesday.', 'In it, they stated: The choice of Kenyas leaders in the election is up to the Kenyan people alone. We do not endorse any candidate or party over another. What we do support is a free, fair, peaceful and credible election.', 'The editorial made no mention of any possible sanctions on Kenya based on which candidate is elected President and also made no mention of consequences or the possibility of having restricted contact with any Kenyan administration.', 'Finally, putting aside our relationships and strategic significance to the international community, there are three fundamental conditions for imposing sanctions that have been historically accepted and observed around the world:', '1) To force cooperation with international law in cases where a government party is not cooperating; 2) To contain a threat to peace within a geographical boundary, for instance by maintaining an illegal nuclear weapons programme; and 3) in following a UN Security Council condemnation of a specific action or policy of a member or non-member nation.', 'None of those three conditions are met in the Kenyan case. Firstly, Mr. Kenyatta is currently cooperating with international law and has pledged to continue to do so.', 'Secondly, our government has no nuclear weapons programme and has made no other threats to peace in our region. And lastly, there has been no UN Security Council condemnation of any action on the part Kenyan government, nor is there any reason to be one in the future.', 'Kenyans need to stop thinking of themselves as in any way beholden to or dependent on western governments for economic subsistence. We have grown beyond that point.', 'But it is because we continue to think of ourselves as inferior, unequal partners to the West that we let ourselves be bullied by campaigners and fearmongers into believing something as ridiculous as the possibility of Kenya facing sanctions for allowing its citizens to democratically elect our next leader.', 'This is a time when the West needs more friends in Africa, not less. Kenya has been a powerful and strategic regional ally to the international community.', 'Europe and America will not choose to damage that important relationship by imposing sanctions - no matter who Kenyans vote for on March 4th.', 'Kenyans should therefore not be intimidated as we move closer to the polls. On March 4th 2013, let us vote; but let not our voting be out of fear, but out of hope.', ' ', 'Sakaja Johnson is the National Chairman, TNA.', '\n']"

I tell this story and no one believes me. This woman required me to treat her badly. Every nice thing I did for her was never appreciated. When I insulted her or disrespected her, she drew closer to me and was at my beck and call. This was a very unnatural state of affairs for me because I have sisters and I expect their boyfriends to treat them like princesses. I could not be the man that treats a woman like shit and yet it was expected of me. I tried. I could not do it. I loved that woman but I had to let her go. Now, the interesting thing is that when I was breaking up with her she said the strangest thing to me. She said that I was just like her father and I would come back to her, eventually. I have never forgotten those words and I think they gave me the strength to stay away from her.', 'Nice guys bore her', 'Her ideal man lives on the edge. He drinks and drives. He parties like a rock star: drugs, alcohol and happy strippers all inclusive. He spends all his earnings within a week of earning them. He is spontaneous to a fault.', 'He slaps her and makes love to her immediately after the sting settles on her cheeks. With her ideal man, there is no monotonous routine and one day is never like the next.', 'He takes control of everything including her and he does what he pleases with her and everything she owns.

Of what use are you to her when your ideas of having fun are going out to dinner, playing scrabble, going to the national park with friends and listening to jazz?', 'Juliet Kanene, 30 says she is tired of nice men. She says, He was so predictable, I could practically mouth his words as he said them, she says of her ex-boyfriend Eugene.', 'She adds that everything they were doing had become a routine, and eventually she got bored, and what was worse, he did not seem to appreciate her efforts of shaking things up.', 'I wanted an exciting man; a man who was unpredictable and interesting- rough and raw. Eugene would not even go bungee jumping. I remember that one time I begged him to go to a couples only road trip with me but once I mentioned that bungee jumping was part of the itinerary, he went cold. I was forced to go with another man, recommended by the person organizing the trip. This other man is now my friend with benefits and I like how things are going. ', ' ', 'Jerks are mysterious and spontaneous', 'Kanene says she gave up a stable relationship for a man who likes being her friend with benefits. He is a mysterious man who most likely has many friends with benefits who he definitely does not want Kanene to care to know about.', 'This qualifies him as an honest man. He is honest to a fault. The fact that he is happy to get the said benefits without exclusively committing to Kanene, also qualifies him as a jerk.', 'And the modern woman loves that type of man. She feels emancipated when she is with a man who is not only her good friend but is also kind enough to let her into his bed. He has allowed her the perks that come with what is politely known as an open relationship.', 'A spade is not a big spoon but an open relationship is a very big spoon that serves promiscuity in good portions. The man is mysterious. He will not let out more information than he should and that intrigues the woman so much, she may even try to be a modern day Nancy Drew, trying to fish for clues and detective-like leads.', 'The aspect of snooping around excites her but once she figures him out, she will get bored or shocked beyond recovery and try to find the next amorous criminal.', 'Kanene says,The fact that my boyfriend did not tell me things, but rather let me find out for myself was exciting, says Irene Musau.

She adds that it was all rosy, until she found him with another woman in her house, on her bed.', ' ', 'She is emotionally immature', 'If you watch soap operas, you may have noticed a pattern or sequence. All the relationships there are a strange imbalance of love and war. They love less and fight more.', 'Drama, tears, deception and mind games are the tricks of an emotionally unstable woman. They get into relationships and turn them into soap operas.', 'Why? Because they believe that nothing good comes to them without giving them trouble. They must sweat and cry for a good relationship.', 'This mentality attracts bad men. Why? Because this is the perfect woman to mess around with without having any effect on the conscience. They dish out as much crap as the man does. In their emotional immaturity, they are jerks at heart. As it is, jerks attract jerks.', 'I am highly attracted to drama queens, says James Owino. He is 34- years-old and he claims to have never dated a sane woman. I love the pushing and pulling. The tags and battles create an excitement that cannot be paralleled and I am a sucker for adrenaline and danger. She gives me hell, I give her hell. She knocks my head with a beer bottle, I threaten to cut her throat with the same bottle.

In search of concrete answers, the Weekend Star has engaged with former internationals, Kenya Premier League (KPL) club chairmen, Football Kenya Federation (FKF) officials and national and club coaches.', 'The responses have been passionate to say the least, with matters ranging from alleged corruption and insufficient finances to inadequate coaching, scouting and even a lack of nutritionists in Kenyan football, as reasons to the Harambee Stars lifelong failures.', 'The common feeling throughout this process was that the Kenyan football system is in desperate need of a complete overhaul before the Harambee Stars can even consider international success.', 'The majority of those involved feel the federation also lacks commitment to the cause of developing footballing standards in Kenya and allege there have been cases of blatant corrupt.', 'Gor Mahia FC Chairman Ambrose Rachier firmly stated: To me, its a question of a lack of planning and a lack of commitment to the development of youth football in our country.', ' He then went on to add: Corruption is there, its dangerous, its a cancer and it trickles down into football. It has a negative effect. For example, if funds meant for the development of football go elsewhere then youre killing football and that is happening.', 'Similar strong sentiments were echoed by former Harambee Stars international Sammy Sholei who not only agreed with Rachier but added: Corruption is a big, big issue in football in this country.', 'He went on to astonishingly accuse the FKF of witch hunting, claiming: If you write exactly what Ive told you tomorrow, youre going to get a letter from the federation. Threats go out even to radio stations. There is one, where I used to go and air my views which also received a letter from FKF.', 'Such widespread condemnation of the FKF by prominent football figures will undoubtedly be hugely concerning for Kenyans; especially considering Kenyas current long-standing poor standards and the believed extent of changes needed to turn that around.', 'The Harambee Stars have never qualified for the World Cup and have failed to make it past round one of the African Cup of Nations. A poor youth development structure figured several times as a key factor in urgent need of transformation.', 'I have never seen any football competition that involves the small kids in this country, former Harambee Stars defender Sammy Omollo observed. And what did the FKF have to say about all this? Efforts to get hold of chairman Sam Nyamweya were unfruitful.', 'However, in an interview with FKF Technical Director Elly Mukolwe, the common theme was ironically money, or a lack of it, more precisely. When asked whether our kids lack competitive football, Mukolwes response was: In our country, the only problem we have is finances.', 'When asked why the Harambee Stars rarely play international friendlies in Kenya, the response was also monetarily driven: We dont have money.', 'If a team comes here, they want us to pay for their accommodation, they want us to pay for their allowances and they want us to pay for their air tickets.', 'Because we dont have money, there is no capacity to play against other nations (at home). We want to expose our players but we cant manage because we dont have money.', 'When asked about the alleged corruption his response was: How can you become corrupt when you dont have the money? You can only be corrupt when you have the money.', 'If one were to base a drinking game over the amount of times Mukolwe used the word money, theyd have passed out before the end of the interview.', 'As FKFs Technical Director, it should of course be Mukolwes job to oversee the technical development of Kenyan footballers. So when asked Does Kenyan football need a distinct style of play to coach players?', 'Mukolwes response was revealing: There are various countries with various types of coaching. It depends on what type of players you have. In Holland they prefer the four by four.', 'Clearly someone needed to inform him that 4-2-4 is traditionally a British system as the Dutch evolved the 4-3-3 from which the concept of Total Football emerged.', 'At least Mukolwe agreed that a complete revamp of Kenyan football was a necessity saying: Yes and this is what were trying to do now. But the hiccups are coming from a lack of finances because football needs a lot of money.', 'In Mukolwes defence, it is true that Kenyan football suffers from a lack of funding and consequently insufficient resources. Mukolwe blamed this on inadequate sponsorship which was also claimed by the others, including Omollo.', 'Theres hardly anybody pumping any money into Kenyan football. Football is largely neglected in this country and the budget for it is something that is small and embarrassing when we talk about budgets Mukolwe said.', 'However, Sholei, Rachier and Omollo all argued that it was the FKFs role to attract much-needed sponsorship and redirect it into football. This, they felt was not being done. The arguments of each and more will be presented each weekend, as we seek to unravel the worrying matter of the Harambee Stars.', '\n']"

While becoming an MP or a senator is the pinnacle of life to many a politician, the Orange Democratic Party nominated Senator from Kakamega County thinks otherwise.', 'As politicians jet set in choppers or their fuel guzzlers, announcing to all and sundry about their next big moves, Omondi is doing the opposite. She has announced her candidature for the Kholera Ward representative in Matungulu constituency.', 'Why would a senator decide to run for an MCA position? The salary of a senator is double that of an MCA. A senator has more privileges compared to a ward rep. The former has more allowances and influence than the latter, so why then, would a senator want to be a ward representative?', 'I have always yearned to work at the village level. This is where a politician who has the welfare of the people at heart, would want to be throughout the year, Omondi says.', 'Since plunging into politics 11 years ago during the Kenya Constitutional Review process that culminated into the promulgation of the countrys new constitution in 2010, the 44-year-old politician had always envisaged herself working at the grassroots level.', 'The mother of three teenagers describes the county assembly as the kitchen of the counties.

I was very upset because I felt I deserved the nomination.', 'Shortly after, when she returned from a conference in Tanzania, an agitated Omondi decided to seek justice. I didnt have money to file the case and to execute of the Sh1 m bond but fortunately, a well-wisher gave me the cash, the senator says.', 'After a six-month court battle, Omondi won the case and was sworn in to Senate on October 15, 2013.', ' I was elated. I deserved the seat because of my many years of tireless work in ODM for the people of Kholera and Kakamega county.', 'Her win was not in vain. Omondis contribution in the Senate has been above average. She has pushed for the implementation of policies and laws that affect people with various disabilities.', 'Persons living with disability have a special spot in her heart. In 2013, she went round the county campaigning for the rights of the disabled but did not relegate issues touching on women, youth and children to the periphery.', 'On February 23, 2013 she brought before the Senate a bill seeking to allow counties to have a disability regional board. This is important to me and others because the boards will ensure the needs of the disabled are effectively addressed at the local levels, she says.', ' I carry the burdens of everyone in the community. I want to do more for the people of Kakamega.', 'Since senators have no funds per se, set aside for various projects unlike MPs, senators are forced to dig deep into their pockets to help those who are in need. The senator often travels all over the country to push governors and other development partners, to come up with friendly policies for people with disabilities.', 'I use my own salary going round the country but I am not complaining as long as I touch somebodys life positively.', 'However, owing to her disability, Omondi is limited in her movements. She, for example, cannot visit far flung areas like Turkana and Northern Kenya where she would like to make the lives of the disabled more comfortable.', 'It is expensive for me to always fly because of limited resources. Also, because I am in a wheelchair, flying means that I must at least travel with two or three people to help me get around.

For example, Mombasa county offers free medical treatment to the disabled and Bungoma county has a disabled fund to empower those living with disability.', 'We make laws at the Senate and allocate monies to counties for various projects but when the funds reach the counties, there are no effective ways of ensuring they are used for the purposes intended, she says as she extends her hand to greet Taita Taveta Senator Boy Juma Boy. I am interviewing her at Parliament Building.', 'The politician had a rough childhood. She had a polio attack when she was only six months old. Four months later, her father died. I thank God for my mother. She was very strong woman. Although the neighbours took jibes at her for caring for a disabled child, she did not give up on me.', 'While her mother chose to remarry later, the marriage did not last due to malicious talks from the villagers. They taunted Omondi calling her a pussycat and always telling her mother to abandon her cat.', 'My step-mother used to talk badly about my mother and I. There was no peace in the home and so my mother left the marriage to take care of me.', 'Omondi faced more uphill challenges going to school even though it was near her home. I used to crawl on all my fours to and from school because I didnt have a wheelchair, she says.', 'This all changed when one day, a well-wisher bought her one after witnessing her struggle going to school. Her fortunes changed when former area MP Dr Elon Wameyo, himself a person who lived with disability, took up the task of sponsoring her throughout high school.', ' He also found me a job which helped me finance my college education, she says. The former telephone operator is forever grateful.', 'She met her husband Alfred Omondi at a church fellowship in Kakamega in 1996. He has been her rock, loving her and supporting her throughout their marriage.', 'When he proposed, she was hesitant because she didnt believe he genuinely wanted to marry a disabled woman and yet there were many beautiful able-bodied women other there.', 'When Alfred and his siblings met my mother to ask my hand in marriage, I started to view him differently. I believed he loved me and wanted us to spend our lives together.

Bayern were a much stronger team and deserved the win at Emirates but Arsenal should have at least put on a more solid display. ', 'That game was very unimpressive from a Gunners point of view. I know Arsenal are weak in defense and defensive midfield positions, but we arent weaker than Blackburn. ', 'We arent useless but sometimes we play like we are. We give up way too easily and its irritating. Manager Arsene Wenger says we mustnt let the defeats to Blackburn and Bayern define the rest of our season but how cant we? ', 'We literally exited two competitions in four days! Thats pretty definitive to me. Aston Villa are a point above the relegation zone but Blackburn arent even in the league, so I cant exactly dismiss them. ', 'Villa have had a difficult time since the New Year with losses to Southampton and Newcastle in the league, Bradford City and Millwall in the FA Cup. But why does this sound so familiar?', ' Because Arsenal have been almost in the same boat. We need to win this game in order to save face and inch closer to Tottenham who are currently warming our fourth position. What these boys need today from Wenger is a pep-talk! Thats it! A motivational speech that allows them to believe in themselves again.', ' QPR Vs Manchester United Today 6pm', 'My prediction:QPR....1 The Red Devils...2', 'Maina Kageni calls QPR a Quarter pound of rubbish! Sadly, despite all the stars in their team and the January acquisition of Christopher Samba, they still are. Arent United such a lucky lot. ', 'At a time when psychologically every three points see their paws on the premier league trophy, they find themselves up against Harry Redknapps confused bunch of has-beens. ', 'Samba couldnt believe that QPR lost 4-1 to Swansea and has called on his new teammates to rise up against United. In their last ten games theyve won two  ironically one of those wins was against Chelsea  lost four and drawn four. Something is fundamentally wrong with QPR and so theres no way of predicting what will happen in this game. ', 'Actually there is: Annoying Manchester United continues to get the job done. I cant believe there are some people saying they havent clinched the league title yet; they have. ', 'Im not saying this because I like them; its just a cold hard fact. Twelve points clear of second placed Manchester City with 12 games to play. ', 'United must lose four games and draw some while City must win all their remaining matches for the result to be any other way. Sir Alex has built a solid team with a winning mentality and while I admire it; I dont like it. Still this game is a no contest.', ' Manchester City Vs Chelsea Sunday 4:30pm', 'My Prediction: The Citizens....2 The Blues...2', 'If ever there was a contest in the premier league at this stage it would be the race for second place. City are currently four points ahead of the Blues and if Chelsea were to win this one then the quest for second spot would look interesting.', ' If City wins then I think that second spot is sealed. City surprisingly gifted Man United the title when they lost 3-1 to Southampton in their last league fixture. ', 'Roberto Mancini had his big guns at his disposal so I really dont know what went wrong for the Citizens there. Chelsea on the other hand havent had an inconsistent season like this one in years. ', 'Losses to teams like Newcastle and QPR and then massive wins against other teams. I hope Rafa Benitez and the Stamford Bridge hierarchy realizes that its the old boys saving them each week. ', 'Frank Lampard, John Terry and the likes are keeping the team afloat. Yes Terry had quite a long injury break but a team needs more than just skilled players. It needs experienced players with a winning mentality and thats what these Mzees have. ', 'Their influence on the younger players is amazing and when I see the likes of Oscar scoring freely, I attribute that to the support he gets from experienced players. Ill be sentimental about this result today and go with a draw.', '\n']"
