The state argues that a fair market price could have been obtained if the proper procedures had been followed.', 'They are also charged with abuse of office in relation to the same transaction. It is alleged that they used their offices to confer upon themselves 318,700,000 Japanese Yen which is the difference between the actual price of 1.75 billion Japanese Yen and 1.4 billion Japanese Yen which is the value the property had been assessed by the government.', ""On third count they are accused of failing to comply with the law relating to procurement in carrying out the transaction. The anti-corruption court magistrate Doreen Mulekye said she will deliver her ruling on the applications by Thuita's lawyers on March 8 and ordered that they post the bail pending their release."", ""Kenyas ambassador to Libya Anthony Mwaniki who at the time of the Tokyo embassy purchase was the charge d'affaires was ordered to appear before Mulekye to plead to the same charges on March 14."", '\n']"
