It is a breeding ground for vultures and eagles. Kenyas geothermal power is sourced here.', 'Hells Gate is the only park in the country where tourists can drive, walk and ride on bicycles. It is famed for its annual wheelbarrow race.', 'Gazetted in 1984, the park which has consistently attracted large numbers of domestic and foreign tourists could soon have its beauty reversed, environmentalists and tour operators warn. This is because more geothermal wells are being sunk by the national power producer, Kengen, in an effort to increase electricity production in the country.', 'Kengen has embarked on the construction of the largest geothermal project as the country moves to initiate green energy projects to cut its dependence on hydro and thermal power.', 'The company currently owns and operates two geothermal power stations at Olkaria namely Olkaria I and Olkaria II.', 'Olkaria IV plant is being put up by a consortium of Japanese firm Toyota Tsusho Corporation and Hyundai Engineering and Construction from South Korea, and is scheduled for completion early next year. But environmentalists are against the project, saying massive destruction of the vegetation would affect wildlife in the park.', 'It is saddening that we are witnessing the ongoing geothermal activity in Hells Gate which violates our national park regulations and is another example of how our parks are becoming the dispersal areas not for wildlife but for development, says Paula Kahumbu who heads WildlifeDirect, a non-governmental organisation providing support to conservationists. It is a shame that this kind of destruction is going on right in one of Kenyas most important vulture breeding areas.', 'While not against the production of geothermal in Olkaria, Kahumbu warns that the ongoing human activities at the park could render some birds like the eagle and vultures extinct.', 'I am shocked that the developers and KWS do not see the contradiction that geothermal energy development is for this tiny spectacular park, she says, this could see the end of eagles and vultures whose breeding place is at the park.', 'She said the government had not released the Environmental Impact Assessment report carried out by the National Environment Management Authority for public scrutiny.', 'She accused KWS of having approved the drilling of more wells in the park instead of protecting it. KWS is mandated to manage and protect parks and not expected to approve this kind of exploitation which threatens the very natural resource that Kenyans gave up for public enjoyment.', 'A visit by the Star recently established that the park is dusty and noisy as heavy vehicles ferried construction materials to Olkaria IV site.', 'Our team saw movement of heavy machinery and dust covering the park as tour guides said wild animals are no longer easily visible like before. Many trees have been cut down to pave way for new roads. A new tarmac road is being laid to Olkaria IV.', 'KWS said it is aware of the negative impacts of the project especially on wildlife and birds. It is true some activities being undertaken in Hells Gate National Park are having negative impacts on wildlife especially birds, said KWS spokesman Paul Mbugua in an email. Both Kenya Wildlife Service and Kengen are aware of the matter and are committed to addressing it.', 'He said the agencies are therefore engaging each other with a view of finding solutions to the problems. KWS is holding several meetings this week (last week) on the same. I suggest I give you answers to your questions early next week, said Mbugua.', 'By the time of going to press yesterday, no comment had been received from KWS.', 'Wildlife (Conservation and Management) Act (Cap 376) prohibits cutting any vegetation in a national park, or clearing, cultivating or breaking up for cultivation any land in a national park.', 'However, Kengen said it had met all environmental requirements before drilling the wells. Everything is in order, says Kaara Wainaina, Kengens corporate communications officer. Before any project is done we have to consult Nema and present our environmental impact assessment and this has been done in all our projects.', 'He said to cushion the rising demand for power in the country, Kengen is doing all at its disposal to ensure that the demand which is rising by 10 per cent a year is met.', 'We have a memorandum with KWS and Nema, he said.', 'He said the project is being funded by international organisations like World Bank and Japan International Corporation which shows that the project had been approved by all relevant authorities.', 'According to the Vision 2030 blueprint, the country has estimated the national peak demand for electricity in the country will be approximately 3,141MW by the year 2014 and approximately 17,000MW by the year 2030.', 'There is also a very well thought out plan on how the management of the waste is done, said Kaara. We did an Environmental Impact Assessment and presented it to Nema who gave us the green light to continue... some of the concerns raised here are what Nema are really concerned about and we factored everything here.', 'The chairman of Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers Ken Korir says the human activities going on in the park are not good for tourism.', 'Korir, who is also the lodge manager, Sarova Hotels, says more geothermal wells could have a very negative impact on the park.', 'We have to come out and set our priorities right. We are seeing a situation whereby the government is turning a blind eye to environmental degradation. Tourism has been the main foreign exchange earner and if we do not look into this matters well, we will lose our tourism, he said.', 'Tourism earnings last year was Sh98 billion, according to the Kenya Tourism Board, a figure Korir says could drop significantly if KWS does not reconsider its stand in parks like Hells Gate.', 'He says an example is the planned bypass that is set to cut through Lake Nakuru National Park which has been approved by the government in disregard of advice from conservationists.', 'There will be a massive migration of birds in Hells Gate, he says. What we are yet to understand is how KWS and Nema allowed such construction in the park.', 'According to him, it would take a long time for the birds and animals to adapt to the noise and the dust in the park.', 'The Kenya Tourism Board refused to be drawn into the matter, saying it was an issue to be tackled by KWS and Nema.', 'KWS and Nema are the best placed to handle this issue, said Kimutai Ngeno, assistant PR manager at KTB. I cannot comment on it.', 'The 140MW geothermal plant is also expected to negatively affect the community living in the area through noise and emissions.', 'Olkaria geothermal field is subdivided into sectors that include Olkaria East (Olkaria I), Olkaria Northeast (Olkaria II),Olkaria West (Olkaria III) and Olkaria Domes (Olkaria IV) where construction is going on now.', 'A report obtained by the Star established that Gibb Africa Ltd undertook the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment study for the Olkaria IV Power Station in 2009 and developed a Resettlement Action Plan for people living near the park and was approved by Nema.', 'Already a 1,700-acre piece of land has been identified to settle people living near domes area in Olkaria and is owned by Kedong Ranch Ltd. The infrastructure to be provided includes access roads, modern houses, a modern school, a social hall, a community water supply system, a cultural centre and churches.', 'Kahumbu says there is need to examine the engagements between KWS and Kengen and the companies that are operating in Hells Gate. We want Nema to take up her role of being the environmental watchdog and conduct a site assessment and blocking any further drilling until the entire debacle is fully investigated, she said.', 'We are seeking the original EIA and environmental license to find out if these wells are in compliance with Environmental and Management Co-ordination Act.', '\n']"

The same local authority does allow subdivision of land to a minimum eighth-acre in areas where the number of family units can be increased. That is, allowing high-density buildings such as apartments.', 'Topography', ' ', 'Land on sloppy areas, such as at RedHill or Muranga, poses a challenge when it comes to laying down the foundation. Such areas require a lot of excavation and need soil-restraining walls. If the cost is not captured in the budget, then this could lead to project cost overruns.', ' ', 'However, slopes have the advantage of being well-drained compared to flat areas such as Ruai, Mombasa Road, South B and C. Flat areas tend to flood in heavy rains, and because of very low water tables, the foundation is usually more expensive, such as in places like Runda and Membley in Ruiru.', ' ', 'It is important to look out for physical presence of temporary water bodies such as streams, rivers and lakes because such areas risk floods when the rivers or streams break their banks. Presence of papyrus reeds and long grass may signify periods of flooding. Dry valleys may be proof of temporary rivers.', ' ', 'Narok and Naivasha towns are a good example of flat land that is prone to flooding in rainy seasons. In these areas, ground floor slab should be higher than ground level.', 'Soils', ' ', 'Constructing on Black Cotton soil presents unique challenges. These soils tend to swell when it rains and contract in dry seasons. This expansion and contraction can push the floor slab upward or downward, creating cracks on it. This requires deeper overhangs and wider external pavements to ensure rain water is kept off the building. Heavy gauge polythene will be requisite to waterproof the soil from the interior. A minimum depth of one foot for hardcore will serve to soak in water and keep the soil dry.', ' ', 'Red soil is stable and does not change in volume when wet or dry hence will cost less to construct on it.', ' ', 'So, if the contractor uses some ingenuity, he or she would save a lot on costs. Simple solutions such as lifting the slab slightly higher from ground level, waterproofing the soil in the foundation and increasing the cement ratio on the ground floor slab can save what would otherwise be spent on excavation and backfilling the foundation.', '\n']"

It needs a tried and tested leader. Not two apprentices of the Likoni Ferry type  accidents waiting to happen. And further distracted by their personal problems. I endorse Raila Odinga for President and urge that he be supported at the polls on election day.', 'There are three key issues  implementation of the constitution, reform (not just of laws but also of values in government and society) and devolution. There are three key qualifications  a track record, sacrifice, consciousness of the ethos of the new constitution.', 'I consider that on these critical issues and these critical qualifications Raila emerges as the candidate most to be trusted to implement the new Constitution fully and within its prescribed time frame. And his main opponent is the least trustworthy on each of these three issues.', 'Constitutions do not come into being of their own. They do not just happen. Raila is the one who has brought about the new Constitution. In 2000, it was Raila, not Moi, who brought KANU to the constitutional review process and facilitated Prof.Ghais chairmanship of the process. ', 'After Moi dissolved Parliament in 2002 and halted the process, Raila revived it in 2003 and brought about Bomas. He did not walk out of Bomas, like Kiraitu and others. When Bomas was ended without its recommended Constitution, and a fraudulent substitute put to the country, Raila led the country in the Referendum of 2005 to reject it. ', 'Raila was dropped from the Cabinet. After the 2007 PEV and the 2008 National Coalition, Raila again put constitutional review on Agenda IV. Raila and Kibaki then brought the Review law to Parliament in 2008, pushed the process through its many steps and campaigned the Referendum of 2010 to victory. Railas culminating point after 12 years of moving constitutional reform was the Promulgation on 27 August 2010.', 'This is the candidate who will best defend and apply the Constitution towards protection of the weak. No candidate can guarantee every right or fulfil every promise. ', 'But Raila is the most experienced and able candidate in this election. This is shown by his purpose in the years he suffered. That purpose was others, not himself. Such suffering does not bring a person wealth. It was done out of a nationalist conviction. What nationalist or political conviction does any deed of Uhuru show us? None comes to mind. ', 'This absence is also shown by his quick readiness to hand over the country to Ruto to run. Yet all Kenyans know that Ruto is against the Constitution, and that Kenyans in 2010 expressly and overwhelmingly rejected Rutos stand. ', 'This is how persons without strong or any political convictions approach high political office. The vacuum in Uhurus beliefs and convictions will soon translate into a vacuum of power in government. This will then be swiftly filled by the exclusive ethnic elites in the Civil Service and ethnobusinesses pushing now for his election. This, and therefore Uhuru and Ruto, are I believe a major danger to Kenya.', 'In contrast, Railas persistence over 30 years on behalf of the people of Kenya has earned him respect from crowds in every part of the country. He was the motor in the elections team of FORD-Kenya in 1992, when FORD-Kenya emerged as the only political party to win a seat in every province of Kenya. ', 'Raila has sacrificed for the country, and tested his ideas for the country. Firstly, through his detention, torture, prison and exile in the 1980s and 1990s. Secondly, through his sacrifice in placing Kenya above himself, giving up his 2007 election victory and agreeing in 2008 to come in on a National Coalition in the national interest.', 'It is Raila who has brought us to 2013 in a manner that is still holding Kenya together. Not Uhuru nor TNA nor their shadowy backers. Railas huge efforts to this end contrast with the failure of the same type arrangement in Zimbabwe. And show what we owe him.', 'What has Uhuru sacrificed for Kenya that enables him to claim the best right to prescribe for its future? Uhuru parrots only one answer : that it is his democratic right to stand. ', 'Not any special fitness, experience or qualification. Nor has he grasped the irony that his democratic right to stand in a multi-party election was brought about by Raila and others and not by himself! ', 'Uhurus standing with KANU in 2002 when he had kept mum throughout the Nyayo KANU years while fellow Kenyans were suffering greatly, showed that he was for the status quo and was not a man for reform. This is what Uhuru still is, though the new Constitution is for change and reform, of both structures and values.', 'Uhuru now pretends that he is for the poor, offering Waititu over the able Jimnah Mbaru. Raila shows that you can be for the poor and others, and still be experienced in administration and government and still respect everybody. ', 'Uhuru has not been for the poor at any time before this. Raila has been for the poor in Langata for the past 20 years as MP, and for them for 30 years through prison, detention and exile. Railas has not been a Luo seat but a Kenyan seat containing all Kenyans. He did not hide in a safe seat, like Bondo, or Gatundu.', 'Uhurus is not the party of the poor. Not with launching a manifesto for the poor with American -style expenditure, music, lights, flags and confetti. Nor is TNA the party of the middle class. The Middle Class are protected and assured growth through rights, only through an implemented Constitution.', 'I believe Raila is the most reliable candidate to complete that necessary constitutional process. I will vote for Raila.', '\n']"
