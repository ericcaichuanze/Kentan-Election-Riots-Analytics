Their workspace is conducive to creativity, and understanding that creativity is an investment; they think long-term."", 'Creative workforce', ""Creative leaders know that the number one practice for successful innovation is a creative workforce. Up to 75 per cent of CEOs name creativity a top skill companies need, and report a shortage of creative employees.

Quick research revealed that there are just over 10,000 bird species on Earth, and about 2,500 species in Africa and about 1,500 species in East Africa.', 'Of these, 500 species exist in the tiny 117 square kilometre Nairobi National Park, compared to the enormous mass of Africa with 30.34 million square kilometers. Therefore, we have about 20 per cent of the bird species in Africa on only 0.0004 per cent of the land.', 'That is incredibly amazing, considering also that the park is surrounded by Nairobi, a growing megacity of over five million people! The park is uniquely located, where a number of different habitat ecosystems converge, therefore contributing to the amazingly brilliant diversity of birds that are unique and localised, in dense forest, riverine forest wetlands, grasslands, shrub-veld, etc.', 'Birds are often doing something interesting if you watch them. Raptors like secretary birds are very rewarding to watch, especially when they are hunting. Some species like the bee-eaters, kingfishers, narina trogon, bush shrikes, grey crowned cranes, saddle-billed storks, various ducks and many more all have beautiful colours and markings.', 'It is a joy to see birds when driving in the park. God has created such amazing diversity. When you go on into the park with the attitude of bird watching, all too often the larger species like rhino, buffalo, and even lions just get in the way!"" But remember, simply speaking, the Nairobi National Park is just brilliant for birds, another reason why the park must be saved!', 'The park is open daily from 06h00 to 19h00.', 'For more information on the park you can link to the following websites www.kws.org or www.nairobigreenline.com or on Facebook.', '\n']"

This has become a common question on television talk shows and among Kenyans.', 'And this shows the concerns people have on whether the IEBC is ready to conduct the polls on August 8. One of the main reasons that has been cited as a hurdle to having an election on August 8 are the many cases, about 9, that NASA has filed in court, among them the petition not to award the ballot printing tender to Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing.', 'But my question is, had the IEBC done everything according to the law, what would NASA have gone to petition against in court? To note, however, the ruling by a three-judge bench comprising Justice Joel Ngugi, John Mativo and George Odunga was not the first. How did we get here? On February 13, Justice Odunga quashed the contract awarded to Al Ghurair and accused the IEBC of failing to comply with the amended election laws of 2016. The Public Procurement Administrative Review Board in May ordered termination of the process of identifying a supplier for the strategic election materials, citing flaws in tender documents, and ordered the process to start afresh. The IEBC also lost when the Court of Appeal ruled that presidential results will be announced at constituency level, saying, The IEBC must be above suspicion to command respect from Kenyans. Judge William Ouko noted it is inconceivable for results announced at this level to be reviewed by the IEBC sitting in Nairobi. Evidently, IEBC is the source of its problems and it has not learnt from its predecessors. ', 'Kenya has conducted elections for decades ,and under multiparty democracy since 1992. The 2002 election was the only election that didnt have issues. The opposition, learning from the past, has a responsibility to fix all the loopholes it thinks could be used to rig the election. And when we go to the polls without fixing these issues, and having court rulings that favour the opposition, they will have every ground to petition a President Uhuru Kenyatta win, and probably lead to the cancellation of that victory. ', 'And the preparedness concerns come with issues of technology too. Three weeks to the election, have the additional BVR kits arrived in the country, when will they be distributed and when will they be tested? Most of the kits in 2013 evidently failed to transmit results to the national tallying centre as had been envisioned. There were also problems with voter identification as kits failed to identify some registered voters or didnt operate for lack of power backup.', 'Causes of these inefficiencies and failures have been explained by various institutions and pundits. They range from late procurement and failure to test and debug. Could we be back to the 2013 mess? Every indication shows that.', 'Kibii comments on international and current issues', '\n']"

Ultimately, we must do everything to\navoid violence. If we dont, it will lead to destruction of the country and\nuselessness of power by whoever will win it.

Tolerance and restrain not only allows us to listen to the views of\nothers and agreeing with them but it also allow us to accept results of an election\nthat might give power to our political enemies. ', ' ', 'Without tolerance, we cannot accept defeat and the victory of our\ncompetitors and vice versa.', ' ', ' It is the beginning of chaos and violence before and after\nelections, when we become intolerant. To go into peaceful polls, therefore,\nboth others and we must embrace tolerance during campaigns and after the\nelection. Only then can we live with unpleasant poll results. ', ' ', 'Yet we find it easier to accommodate tolerance and restrain when we\ncampaign and deal with results of elections as individuals and not as\ncommunities. ', ' ', 'When we go into elections as communities, going to vote for our own to\ncapture power and to vote out other communities from power, we find it more\ndifficult to accept results.

This is a mindset that understands that the process involves twists, turns and constant adjustments. So, what is the proof that were ready to learn? A learning plan. The innovation process is full of mistakes (gold mines or learning opportunities). And we should have a mechanism or system to harness these mistakes.

One key element for the success of an ideas is the energy level of the persons driving it.', 'What is your energy level? Do you have the passion, psychological or emotional drive to inspire or energize others to help you make your idea work? Is your energy sustainable?

Most Kenyans think\nthat no party is going to respect the manifesto if it wins. ', ' ', 'But they are  or should be  important. It is\nimportant that the voters have some idea of what parties promise. When a party\nis in government, its manifesto promises can be used as a mobilising tool,\nproviding a basis for demanding that it take certain action. And when the next\nelections come round, people should be asking whether the government actually\ndid what it undertook to do.', ' ', 'WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO\nDO WITH THE CONSTITUTION?', ' ', 'Our concern  for the purposes of Katiba Corner\n was with how far the manifestos show concern with and understanding of the Constitution,\nand a commitment to implementing it. Jubilee mentions it four times and the Thirdway\nAlliance Kenya 11. ', ' ', 'It is unnecessary to count the references in\nNASAs manifesto because it makes the Constitution central. Its foreword even\nsays, Even the most casual glance will not fail to notice that our platform is\nthe Constitution of Kenya 2010. We are the Coalition of the Constitution.\nThere is much emphasis on the national values, found especially in Article 10.\nIn fact, so familiar will this approach be to readers of Yash Ghais columns\nhere, that we feel obliged to make a disclaimer: No Ghais were involved in the\npreparation of the NASA manifesto!', ' ', 'We hope to return to some issues of the\nConstitution as revealed in the manifestos, whether explicitly or not, in some\nlater Katiba Corner. Here, however, we consider an issue that has attracted\nsome attention in the press. ', ' ', 'NASAS PLAN TO\nCHANGE THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT', ' ', 'NASA proposes to amend the Constitution in a significant\nway, introducing what it describes as a hybrid system, as in the Bomas (National\nConstitutional Conference) draft Constitution. They say this would enhance\ncohesion, be more inclusive (as opposed to the current exclusive presidential\nsystem), give a chance to people from smaller communities to attain the highest\noffice in the country, and encourage power sharing. ', ' ', 'Bomas proposed what is usually called a\nparliamentary system. It would have been more like the system Kenya had in 1963\n before the first President Jomo Kenyatta decided that he wanted more power\nthan he had as Prime Minister, and persuaded Parliament to change the\nConstitution. ', ' ', 'In a parliamentary system, the people elect a\nparliament as we do now. But the head of government (the Prime Minister) is not\nseparately elected by the people. He or she must be a Member of Parliament (of\nthe National Assembly in our case). If one party gets more than half the seats,\nthat partys leader will be Prime Minister (PM). If necessary, the leader of (probably)\na large party may form a coalition or agreement with one or more other parties\nto ensure enough support. ', ' ', 'The really important characteristic of a\nparliamentary system is that the government remains in office only so long as\nit has the support of the peoples representatives in parliament. If a vote of\nno confidence is passed by parliament the PM must resign. The Bomas draft\nincluded this.', ' ', 'In most parliamentary systems, the ministers\n(now called Cabinet Secretaries) are also MPs. Bomas proposed that the\nMinisters would be members of the National Assembly, but that the Senate would\nhave to approve them. ', ' ', 'HEAD OF STATE IN A PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM ', ' ', 'Parliamentary systems usually have a separate\nhead of state  a queen/king or president. Sometimes that head of state has no\nreal power, but formal functions only. Sometimes he or she has some powers that\nmight be used to exercise a bit of control over the government if they are\nbehaving unwisely or even becoming oppressive. The functions of the head of state are also usually thought to include\nbeing a national symbol of unity, and maybe a voice of reason and sound advice\nbased on personality, experience and moral authority. It can be useful to have\nsomeone to perform the ceremonial functions, leaving the PM to carry on the\nserious business of government.', ' ', 'Heads of state in parliamentary systems are (if\nnot hereditary) usually chosen by parliament. The Bomas draft was a bit unusual\nbecause it proposed that the president should be directly elected by the\npeople. This is the arrangement in Ireland, where it is felt that this gives\nthe President some extra strength as the peoples choice, even when the legal\npowers of the office are not great.', ' ', 'Bomas also would have given the President some\nextra powers. She [why not?] would have had the power to propose to the\nNational Assembly a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister. She would\nannually address Parliament on the progress achieved in the realisation of the\nnational goals and values. She would have annually reported to Parliament on\nhow far the country had achieved its international obligations these would be\nmostly about human rights and the environment. She could have proposed new laws\nto Parliament. ', ' ', 'All these functions would give the President\nthe power to make his or her own decisions or judgments, not just to do what\nsomeone else says. They are quite unusual. But they do not go to the extent of\nallowing the President to make governmental decisions. They are all about\nhelping to keep the government, and parliament, on the right track  checks and\nbalances. For this reason it is not quite correct to describe this as a hybrid\nsystem as NASA does. That description is better reserved for systems like the\nFrench where the Prime Minister and the President both make decisions about\ngovernmental policy and action. ', ' ', 'The Constitution of Kenya Review Commission,\nBomas and the Committee of Experts all proposed a system rather like this. You\ncan see why NASA might favour it. A political party in the current Kenyan context\nis unlikely to form government alone. It will either be a sort of composite\nparty, or form a coalition after elections. With a parliamentary system it\ncould offer important roles for people from these various, ethnic groups  the Bomas draft included\ntwo Deputy Prime Ministers as well as fifteen to 20 ministers plus deputy ministers.', ' ', 'Another possible benefit is that the system\nfocuses less on the single top dog role of President, perhaps making\nelections less of a do-or-die affair.', ' ', 'SO WHY IS THIS NOT\nTHE SYSTEM WE HAVE? ', ' ', 'Partly, people find it hard to imagine a\ndifferent system and perhaps they saw this as something unusual (though\nparliamentary systems are found in over 60 countries in the world). After the\nnational coalition government of Mwai Kibaki and Raila Odinga following the 2007-08\npost-election violence, people seemed less enthusiastic about a parliamentary\nsystem. ', ' ', 'The Parliamentary Select Committee reviewing\nthe Committee of Experts draft actually changed a basically parliamentary\nsystem to the current US-style presidential one. And, though we do not know the\ndetailed dynamics of that meeting, it seems clear that ODM went along with it \nand cheerfully. The suspicion was that they then believed that ODM could win\nthe presidential prize. This was despite what had seemed to be the life-long\ncommitment to a parliamentary system of people like Raila , and even of our\ncurrent Deputy President, as he professed at a meeting during Bomas.', ' ', 'CONCLUSION', ' ', 'It must be clear that Yash Ghai has tended to\nfavour a parliamentary system. It does not necessarily follow that it makes\nsense to make another radical constitutional change at this stage. Sometime the\nimportant thing is to make the constitution you have work rather than to try\ntinkering with it.', ' ', 'And  a word of warning: It is not unusual for\npeople who have argued, even fought, for a new system of government, to change\ntheir minds if they manage to get into power under the old, once maligned\nsystem. After\nall, they seem to think, if they got into power through this system, maybe its\nnot so bad!', '\n']"

The casting of Marisa Tomei as a young Aunt May was highly\ncriticised, but it works. Since the new Spider-Man is an actual teenager it\ndoes make a lot of sense that he has a young, attractive aunt whom he can\nrelate to.

However, there has actually been a rift in that shift. Things may not be so rosy for NASA, after all. The vote-rich region collectively known as the Rift Valley or the Rift in short, is home to 24 per cent of all the 19.6 million registered voters.', ' ', 'Thats a huge chunk of the pie, which is why it is being staked out vigorously by both sides of the political divide. Already, out of the 14 counties in the Rift, there are those that are in the firm grip of either NASA or Jubilee. Of the total votes in the Rift, the Kalenjin and the Kikuyu vote is overwhelmingly in the majority, and this is why Jubilee has marked it as its stronghold. In terms of absolute numbers, NASA is the follower. To reverse this, the opposition coalition has been employing the political clout of Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto a NASA principal, who is also a bitter rival of DP Ruto. His brief is simple  deliver the Rift to NASA.', ' ', 'The rise of Isaac Rutto ', ' ', 'To increase his political clout, Governor Rutto was enthroned as the Kipsigis spokesman, a move that has caused controversy within the Kalenjin community. Pundits have dismissed it as a divisive and one aimed at splitting the Kalenjin vote ahead of the August 8 polls.', ' ', 'Hard questions have been asked in nearly every Kalenjin vernacular radio station that beams over the Rift Valley. Caller after caller has dug in to the meaning of the enthronement of Rutto as the Kipsigis spokesman, and what it means for the community. The big question is whether the Kalenjin community is better off in a NASA or Jubilee government. Going by the sentiments of the callers, the overwhelming majority seem to be firmly in the Jubilee court.', ' ', 'Their main argument has been who has a better chance of taking over the leadership of Kenya between DP Ruto and Governor Rutto. They argue that Rutto has joined the NASA bandwagon in position five, which means if the opposition principals were to lead Kenya in the order they came in, he has no chance of leading the Kalenjin to Canaan in his lifetime.', ' ', 'Crowd-pulling in NASA rallies ', ' ', 'Wesley K is a young person aged 24, who hails from Silibwet, Bomet county. I met him last year, when conducting some historical research in the county. After my research, we spoke about political matters and I found him to be quite updated on the goings-on in Bomet, enumerating the political weaknesses of his governor. When I spoke to him last week, he confirmed that together with many of his fellow villagers, he was present at the massive NASA rally hosted by Rutto at the Bomet Green Stadium two weeks ago.', ' ', 'I asked whether he was now convinced to vote for NASA, and he was firmly in the negative, saying he was now even more convinced to vote for Jubilee. Several other people that I called were not convinced by NASA. Even then, Rutto has his own (firm) backers, who have given currency to his position in NASA. The main concern of those backing Rutto is the impact of the Sh38 billion Itare Dam project by the Jubilee government.', ' ', 'The politicisation of Itare dam ', ' ', 'The Sh38 billion Itare Dam is turning out to be an example of the politicisation of resources, with the undertones of resource nationalism. It has ceased to be an environmental issue, or even one about the economy of Kericho or the fate of the tea industry, jobs and blah. It is not surprising that the elders behind the enthroning of Rutto to the position of the Kipsigis spokesman are also associated with the attempt to stall the said project.', ' ', 'They want to place Itare Dam on the political forefront against all odds. Last year they met with Raila Odinga at a Kericho hotel and have used his now close association with Governor Rutto to champion their case. Their concerns on Itare Dam have consistently been downplayed by the Jubilee government, and are frustrated that it has not gained traction as a political issue among the Kipsigis. Some of the most vocal champions against the Itare Dam is Joel Kimeto, the chairman of the Kipsigis Clans Association, an organisation that brings together about 250 Kipsigis clans. (Joel Kimeto should not be confused with his namesake, a Kipsigis gospel musician).', ' ', 'It was from his platform that he organised the installation of Rutto to become the Kipsigis spokesman together with his fellow anti-dam champions William Ketienya and Wilson Sigei. The argument was that Rutto, as a NASA co-principal would be able to champion issues close to the Kipsigis, but the truth is that Itare dam is probably their main issue. Kimeto led the team that organised the July 1 ceremony, which led to the enthronement of Rutto as the Kipsigis spokesman. The ceremonial Sambuut outfit was placed on Rutto by Bartaa araap Milgo, a Kipkenda elder from Chebunyo. However, during his speech, Ruttos Sambuut fell, which was immediately picked up by his opponents as a sign of mischance.', ' ', ' ', 'Governor Rutto hails from the Kipkenda clan, one of the largest Kalenjin clans that runs in several sub-tribes, including the Tugen, the Nandi, the Marakwet, the Keiyo and the Kipsigis. On the other hand, DP Ruto comes from the Komosiik clan, a sub-clan of the larger Kibiegen clan, prominent in Nandi, Kipsigis, Terik and Tugen. The Nandi equivalent of his clan is Kapsatoo, who have been infuriated by Rutto threatening the pre-eminence of their cherished son.', ' ', 'The Bomet governor is genealogically from Kipsigis migrants, who had settled for many years in Nandi and Uasin Gishu. His father Mzee Paulo T (I will only use first names to protect their privacy) was an itinerant preacher associated with the Tendereza movement that was very popular in Nandi from the 1950s through to the early eighties. He in fact settled at Cheptiret in Uasin Gishu, where Governor Rutto was born. In his adulthood the governor eventually settled in Tumoi, Bomet, making it the seat of his family.', ' ', 'On the other hand, DP Rutos father Mzee Daniel S first came to Nandi in 1964, following in the footsteps of his cousin Mzee Simeon K, who first came to Nandi in 1960 from Cheptuiyet village, Kericho, and settled in Kipsiorori village in Kaptumo.', ' ', 'However, Mzee Daniel could not find a suitable land in Kaptumo and it was just about that time that a window opened in Jua Kali area near Eldoret, when departing Europeans were selling land. And so he moved to Uasin Gishu and established a new family, whereupon the DP was born in 1966. Two sons were born in a crossed heritage and have become the bitterest of political adversaries, each staking a claim on their political backyard  the Rift Valley.', ' ', 'War of the in-laws ', ' ', 'The conflict between Governor Rutto and DP Ruto is a little deeper than that of the Capulets and the Montagues. Most Kenyans have attributed it to petty jealousies, pride and egoism on both sides. However, it is a most confounding proposition indeed. Ruttos wife is from the Deputy Presidents clan, making this essentially a war of the in-laws. Pundits have argued that one should respect their in-laws and have called on Rutto to respect the DP. But it gets trickier.', ' ', 'When Joel Kimeto a member of the Kaboboeek clan (a brother clan of the Kapkomosiik clan) organised the installation of a member of Kipkenda clan, he was effectively handing over power to another clan away from his own. DP Ruto has already been once before installed as a Kalenjin spokesman and his was done only after Moi had retired from the presidency. It is, therefore, argued that you cannot draw power or share it from your brother-in-law, a relationship among the Kalenjin that is highly revered.', ' ', 'A house divided ', ' ', 'The move by the Kipsigis Clans Association elders to enthrone the Bomet governor has infuriated the larger Myoot (Kalenjin) Council of Elders, which brings together many more elders from all the Kalenjin sub-tribes. Their Kipsigis chairperson Bishop Paul Leleito, who was not present, has distanced himself from that elevation. They have castigated the KCA, saying it was usurping powers vested in the Myoot Council of', ' ', 'Elders that oversees the cultural work of the entire community. They said that they did not recognise the elevation of Rutto, insisting there was no vacuum in the house to warrant such a move. They further argue that in the current political dispensation, the Deputy President was elevated to the communitys spokesman in June 2006 because he was the senior-most Kalenjin politician after the retirement of President Moi.', ' ', 'Back in 1966, Moi had himself been enthroned in a similar ceremony held in Nandi (which enjoys pre-eminence as the upper house in all the 10 Kalenjin sub-tribes). Moi was enthroned in a ceremony attended by various representatives of the Kalenjin community held in Kapsabet in 1966.', ' ', ""The 'prophecy' of Mugeni "", ' ', 'Back in 2007  at the height of his popularity among the Kalenjin  some people predicted the presidency of Raila, saying that Mugeni had said so. Mugeni, who died between 1890 and 1900, became one of the most quoted Kalenjin prophets (particularly loved by the late Kipsigis musician Kipchamba araap Tabotok).', ' ', 'Pundits attributed to Mugeni a prophecy to the effect that the leadership of the country would come from the lake. That is how Raila got the name araap Mibei for indeed he hails from the lake region and became wildly popular among the Kalenjin. However, when in 2007 he failed at the polls, many dismissed the prophecy as fake.', ' ', 'A modified version of the prophecy did the rounds, saying that Mugeni said the man would win but would never rule... It is this new prophecy that has dampened Railas prospects among the Kalenjin, and it is in part the reason why he has not risen at the polls among them.', ' ', ""Politics of the 'Sambuut' "", ' ', 'Back in October 1905, shortly after the murder of the Orkoiyot Koitalel Samoei by British forces, his cousin Kibeles was enthroned as the Chief Laibon over the Nandi. Col. R Meinertzhagen, leader of the expedition that killed Koitalel, took a photo of the new Laibon in his regalia of office (Sambuut). The power of raising and blessing leaders was traditionally attributed to the Talai clan, which Koitalel and Kibeles belonged to. However, Kibeles died in September 1911 and it fell upon the young son of Koitalel named araap Koitalel to become the next Laibon.', ' ', 'However, the British quickly found out that he was not recognised by the Nandi, who instead recognised Barsirian araap Manyei his younger brother. Manyei, was a non-collaborator and after cancelling the Sagetab Eito ceremony he had organised in 1923, the British exiled him to various places in Kenya, ending up as the longest serving Prisoner of Conscience in Kenyan history ( 1923-61 ). Upon release through the gallant effort of Nandi MP Jean-Marie Seroney, Manyei placed the Sambuut over Seroney on January 14, 1962, shortly before he left for the Lancaster House Conference in London.', ' ', 'Manyei was chosen to enthrone Jomo Kenyatta as a Kenyan leader, a ceremony which he performed on December 12, 1963 on Independence Day. Manyei placed the Sambuut over Jomo Kenyatta and blessed him. The next ceremony was that of Moi held at Kamatargui near Kapsabet in 1966. This, however, was not performed by Manyei but by two elders from his clan.', ' ', ""Controversies of the 'Sambuut' "", ' ', 'However, the elevation of Vice President Moi was much to the chagrin of his fellow politician Seroney, who was against power moving from the Upper House (Nandi) to the Tugen. Seroney was so infuriated that he refused a heifer handed to him as a gift (an act considered extraordinarily impolite). Moi became VP for 12 years and then ruled for another 24 years. At the end of his tenure, he was asked to hand back the Sambuut given to him in 1966. He was said to have declined when he learnt that Ruto would be given the same.', ' ', 'The Myoot elders then organised another ceremony and gave Ruto another monkey-skin outfit at the Eldoret Sports Club in June 2006. Being that his animal totem is the Baboon (Kibiegen), pundits argued that it was home. They were then understandably surprised when they learnt of the elevation of Rutto and they were not even invited. Interviewing one of them Samuel Ngeny of Nandi, he categorically stated that the elders did not recognise the elevation of Rutto because it was not consultative and lacked consensus.', ' ', 'A female elder, Everlyn Ruto, who is a current member of the Myoot Council, dismissed it, saying it was not good when the ceremony was followed by an outcry. She argues that the ceremony was done within a political context, and the attendance of alien people made it lose its sacredness. Those who support the move say Rutto from the Kipkenda clan is from a house of leaders starting from the legendary prophet Mugeni.', ' ', ""The significance of the 'Sambuut' "", ' ', 'The Sambuut is a garment that signifies authority and power among the Kalenjin. Few politicians have been given the said garment, which is why it was a big deal that Rutto was one. Prior to the coming of the Myoot Council of Elders, a few people  mainly members of the Talai clan  would conduct the ceremony and in fact enthroned Raila at a ceremony carried out in,Nandi, in November 2016.', ' ', 'This, however, was dismissed as being driven by commercial interests cashing in on politicians keen to stamp their authority over the Kalenjins.', ' ', 'The Myoot Council of Elders, which is drawn from most of the Kalenjin sub-tribes, is currently backing DP Ruto, which is why there is essentially no shift in the Rift.', '\n']"

But the opposition has filed many court cases, creating a lot of hurdles for the IEBC to adequately prepare for the election.', 'On Wednesday, NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga said there is increased mobilisation of the military forces in favour of President Kenyattas Jubilee. ', 'He raised similar claims a month ago, where he alleged that the government was recruiting and training some members of the military and police to work as Jubilee agents. This is purely built on speculation. No tangible evidence has been adduced. ', 'The other move regards the queries on the credibility of the the audit of the national voter register, which was carried out by the internationally accredited and renowned audit firm KPMG.', 'If NASA has its way, then it means the August 8 election will likely be postponed. The date of the election is factored in the Constitution, and can only be altered through a constitutional amendment. This leads to the question, are the concerns raised by NASA so weighty to warrant this constitutional amendment? ', 'The leadership of Jubilee wants the election on August 8 because they strongly believe in the Constitution and the rule of law.', 'For me, NASAs stand is bound to raise queries. First, most of their claims are propaganda and meant to mislead and incite Kenyans. When they say members of the disciplined forces are being recruited to man the election and fail to prove the claims, such a message is designed to trigger violence. In the countdown to the 2007 polls, the NASA flagbearer read the same script about use of AP officers. I dont need to revisit what happened thereafter.', 'A friend of mine told me a few days ago that Raila has sensed defeat. This explains why NASA is coming up with all manner of excuses that do not really add up. A time has come for security agencies to deal with politicians beating the drums of war. This is the only way to avert a repeat of the 2007 chaos.', 'He further noted, Raila wants the election to be postponed so that he can force President Uhuru to accommodate him in a caretaker or interim government.', 'My response was simple and clear. If this is the card Raila and his brigade are playing, it is doomed to fail because if the election is postponed, the incumbent government will continue to govern until the polls are held.', 'For the sake of argument, let us assume the election is postponed. For NASA, it will be a big shame if it still ends up losing. ', 'For me, the concerns NASA has raised are not strong enough to warrant the postponement of the election. These are issues that can be sorted out if formally brought to the attention of the electoral commission.', 'The IEBC has always demonstrated readiness to listen to them. It has invited the NASA principals to a number of meetings and gave an opportunity to present their grievances.', 'Notably, NASA, which then operated under the banner of Cord, played a vital role in recruiting, vetting and appointment of the new IEBC commissioners. This process would be preceded by the mass action they organised to push for the hounding out of the Issack Hassan-led commission from office. Again, Raila and his brigade didnt bother to substantiate their allegations that the Hassan team manipulated the results of the 2013 polls in favour of UhuRuto.', 'It is worth recalling that Raila lost his petition when they took the matter to the Supreme Court. The highest court in the land upheld Jubilees victory. Notably, Raila had played a key role in forming the Hassan team as the Prime Minister. Does this mean he will only support and trust a team that declares him President?', 'Ours is a participatory democracy where power comes from the people. ', 'Therefore, he should refocus his energy on seeking the mandate of the people. The days when leaders would use short cuts to power and force a Nusu Mkate government are long gone.', '\n']"

We mourn the passing on of Amb Bethuel Kiplagat, an eminent leader and consummate diplomat in our country and continent. ', 'I am privileged to have interacted extensively with the late Amb Kiplagat and to have acquired first hand professional insights through his tireless efforts to raise Kenyas profile internationally and to champion the noble course of peace in our nation, the East African Community and Africa as a whole.', 'My initial contact with the late Amb. Kiplagat was at Kenyas Foreign Ministry where he had an outstanding 13 years career from 1978 to 1991.', "" He served as Kenya's Ambassador to France (1978-1981), High Commissioner to the United Kingdom (1981-1983), and Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation between 1983 and 1991."", 'His tenure at the Ministry coincided with the so-called lost decade for Africa - a period in which there was widespread misconceptions about Africa; then regarded as a hopeless continent. These perceptions at the global level resulted in diminished international engagement with Africa. ', 'This difficult period was followed by the wave of democratization that swept across Africa following the implosion of communism in the late 1980s and shortly thereafter by the rise of neoclassical economics. ', 'These latter developments demanded both political and economic liberalization in Africa which presented immense challenges for African nations in their engagements at the international arena.', 'Navigating International Relations at this time was therefore a considerable challenge, demanding creativity, hard work and sufficient enterprise. Unmatched in his creativity, insight and drive, the late Amb. Kiplagat was equal to the task. ', 'A dynamic leader and team worker, he was instrumental in the introduction of strategic approaches and fresh perspectives in the conduct of Kenyas diplomatic relations. This ushered in a new assertive and progressive profile for Kenya on the world stage.', 'His efforts helped to raise Kenyas diplomatic posture internationally and expand our engagements at the bilateral and multilateral levels. ', 'The continued deepening of this agenda has today availed remarkable benefits to the conduct of Kenyas foreign policy and leadership on regional and multilateral issues.', 'An effective negotiator, the late Ambassador also had an impressive career as a peacemaker who contributed immensely to peace initiatives and processes in Africa. ', 'He served in various peace engagements in Africa including as Kenyas Special Envoy to the Somalia Peace Process from 2003 to 2005; Chairman of the IGAD Technical Committee on Somali National Reconciliation Conference and resource person to the IGAD Peace Process for Sudan and advisor to Sudanese civil society on conflict resolution. ', 'During the Second Sudanese civil war between 1989 and 2005, Amb. Kiplagat was instrumental in facilitating Operation Lifeline Sudan, the largest ever coordinated humanitarian effort that allowed actors to supply assistance to critically war and drought stricken areas in the South of the country. ', 'This intervention was operated from Lokichogio, a town 30kms from the Kenya-South Sudan border. ', 'Although the OLS commenced in 1989 after consistent deliberations within the international community, during his tenure as Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amb Kiplagat had led efforts to facilitate humanitarian interventions in the Sudan as early as 1985. ', 'In fact, the Government of Kenya under his advice and the leadership of former President Daniel Arap Moi had facilitated cross-border efforts by private entities from Kenya to Sudan. ', 'His firm conviction about the role of Kenya in the welfare of her neighbours and in alleviating war and human suffering has been a mark of the countrys steady peace and security engagements; including as a significant player within the United Nations Peacekeeping Missions.', 'Amb Kiplagat was also involved in peace negotiations in Ethiopia (1988-1992), Mozambique (1988-1992), and Uganda (1985-1986). He later founded the Africa Peace Forum, a not-for-profit initiative facilitating research and advocacy on areas of peace and security at national, regional and international level.', 'He epitomized great optimism and conviction that through genuine engagements in the spirit of give and take, parties to conflict can lay a firm foundation for peace and a bright future for generations to come. ', 'He courageously sought to broaden the moral imagination of mediators and conflicting parties to dare to imagine neither what was has transpired, nor what is obtaining, but what could be.', 'He was a practical visionary and peace-seeking leader whose contribution in the peace processes constitutes some of his enduring imprints on the sands of time. ', 'To be sure, the late Amb Kiplagat has contributed immensely to Kenyas global reputation for peace making in Africa.', 'As former colleague, we at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continue to uphold the proud tradition that he and other predecessors have bequeathed on us. ', 'This is the only way we can best honor those who have gone before us for the distinguished service they rendered to this nation.', 'I pray for Gods comfort and fortitude upon his immediate and extended family, friends and colleagues during this sad period.

The TV stations are unlikely to be getting into this business as missionaries; that is unlikely to be their newfound contribution to philanthropy at election time. ', 'Politicians know that election time is when there is a high premium to adverstise and the media falls into good times in such moments. Bring popular politicians on the screen for a verbal duel and all their supporters and detractors will no doubt be glued. Advertisers will no doubt scramble for space, definitely at a premium price. Now, begin following my trend of thought if you are still wondering where I am going.', 'Second, which politician will, therefore, like to be used opportunistically as Raphael Tuju put it? To begin with, a participant in the debate such as President Uhuru and Raila would need full disclosure about DBL: Its directors, the purpose for which the firm was set up and whether any other political entity  locally or abroad  has some interest or influence on it. These are pertinent issues that cannot be swept under the rug. DBL should be aware that sections of the public are asking these questions. Kenyans have become much more aware of their need to know than ever before.', 'Third, both Raila and Uhuru are themselves walking television stations. In other words, wherever they are, the media will run after them looking for news. They sell. But they have never asked any media owner to pay them royalties although they make money for them. They get something in return which is difficult to quantify  publicity. Ask yourself now, why would Raila and Uhuru risk getting some publicity whose content they are not sure of, when they know fully well that just by staying away from the debate that will itself be news? I may sound like a cynic but the question is worth asking. Swallow that and I will tell you another.', 'Fourth, I have talked about content, let me elaborate. In the US, where such debates have become an accepted tradition, there are some procedures that are always followed, and which are well known to both the candidates and the debate organisers. In fact, these procedures were worked on quite some time ago to the extent that they have become part of the political culture in that country. In our case, these procedures still exist in the heads, or perhaps the files, of institutions such as DBL. Advertising these procedures in the newspapers and assuming that presidential candidates will read and agree with them automatically is perhaps presumptive at best and naive at worst. ', 'My advice would run something like this. Put in the newspapers an announcement that you would like to have an open forum on presidential debates to which all political parties are invited. Simultaneously to that announcement, write a much more detailed letter to all those who have announced intentions to be president to come and participate in the forum, or send their representatives. This should have been done early last year. It would have set the ball rolling on this discourse that would have made most candidates have a  buy in much earlier rather than be confronted with a fait acompli katika kipindi cha lala salama as we witnessed early last week.', 'Fifth, make sure that such open fora gradually and systematically develop the content and format of such debates. Dont make the content and format be a sole product of an institution such as DBL. You are not manufacturing a detergent, where the scientist is the only person who knows the formula. You are dealing with a very versatile, fluid, sensitive and at times slippery social phenomenon called politics. Even the best political players dont know where its boundaries begin or end: They are constantly seeking to keep it in control, manipulate and shape it to their advantage. Why do you think that you can thrash out matters outstanding in organising a debate in less than two weeks when those matters have only been isolated by you and not the key players?', 'Sixth, take note that the key players are not always the key players. While it may be easy to identify the major candidates as the key players, you cannot always rule out the minor candidates as not being the key players (please note my quotes). DBL decided on a solution that was itself part of the problem. This problem could have been sorted out much more systemically had the right procedure been adopted in the first place. But it wasnt.', 'Seventh, please ask yourself the question, how useful are the presidential debates in the Kenyan context?', 'My honest opinion is that they are useful in so far as they provide the voters with an opportunity to see and hear their leaders discussing pertinent issues that a presidential election should deal with. ', 'Further, they should also give journalists as well as the people the opportunity to ask the candidates questions about why they want to be president, and what they are likely to do when they get to power. Now, in the event that the candidates turn down the idea of taking part in a joint live TV debate for whatever reason, we should not cry over spilt milk: All is not lost though heaven appears to be lost. We can do the second-best thing: Invite each candidate to face a panel of questioners to ask him or her about the manifesto, plans for transforming Kenya for the better, how to deal with certain thorny issues as president and so on. The people will have the opportunity to put every candidate under the political microscope and judge for themselves. Due to time, space and viewership I would suggest we give this opportunity to the two leading candidates  Raila and Uhuru.', 'The Kenya Association of Manufacturers two weeks ago on Friday organised a debate between me and Governor Jack Ranguma at Acacia Hotel in Kisumu. The interview was shown widely on a few TV networks and solicited tremendous interest in the county. For those of you who may not be aware, Ranguma and I are standing for Kisumu governor Kisumu in this election. An initiative by NTV to have a rematch last Saturday did not work out because the governor had apparently travelled to Uganda.', 'Maybe the county government of Kisumu should, through a Bill in the County Assembly, pass an enabling legislation encouraging such debates. Such legislation should not be laced by the spice of seeking to control free speech and debate but should encourage a culture of dialogue and political hygiene in public discourse, especially during election time.', '\n']"

The MP garnered 353,604 votes against the incumbents 69,916.', 'The result comes barely three weeks after an opinion poll by Infotrack showed Mr Kabogo would get 48.9 per cent of the votes against Mr Waititus 31.8 per cent, if elections were to be held on April 7.', 'By getting the Jubilee ticket, Mr Waititu is almost certain to be elected Kiambu governor in the August 8 General Election because the county is a Jubilee stronghold.', 'All eyes will now be on the other counties that have been featured by pollsters. In Nairobi, the pollster said Dr Evans Kidero would be reelected as governor by 35.3 per cent of voters.', 'According to Infotrack, his closest challenger for the capitals gubernatorial seat would be Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, who was competing against former MP Peter Kenneth for the Jubilee Party ticket in primaries held yesterday.', 'In Meru, the pollster said Senator Kiraitu Murungi would lose to incumbent Peter Munya in the governor race.', 'A PERSPECTIVE ON COASTAL POLITICS ', 'It is from that perspective that we must view coastal politics as well. All the pollsters seem to believe, for example, that both Governor Amason Kingi in Kilifi and Governor Hassan Joho, aka The Sultan, in Mombasa, are comfortably cruising towards victory largely on the strength of ODM popularity in the polls.', 'Such a view completely overlooks the fact that Joho, for one, is in exactly the same position as Kabogo was when he went into the JP primaries. The Daily Nation reported in a report headlined, Shahbal dismisses poll rating Joho as most popular in Mombasa on March 22 2017:', 'The Jubilee Party aspirant for the Mombasa County governorship, Suleiman Shahbal, has dismissed a poll released on Tuesday morning showing that he is less popular than Governor Hassan Joho, saying it is a fraud.', 'In a statement to newsrooms, Mr Shahbal who lost out to Mr Joho in the 2013 elections, questioned the integrity of pollster Tifa (Trends and Insights For Africa) which showed his rival has a 68 per cent popularity rating.', 'From the onset the poll looks suspect, and therefore bogus, whose results cannot be relied upon to inform the mood on the ground in Mombasa.', 'The pollsters, whether they went to the ground to seek opinions or not seem to be more focused on gauging, or informing the public, what Mombasa people felt about the Mtongwe Ferry debacle, he argued.', 'A Breaking News video item trumpeted in a headline on the Nation website, Johos popularity is overrated because he pays pollsters  Hassan Omar.', 'Mombasa Governor Hassan Ali Joho is the favorite to retain his gubernatorial seat by an overwhelming majority if the election were held today, according to an opinion poll released in Nairobi. The poll shows that Joho would win the poll by 68 per cent. Margaret Ireri the Director of Trends and Insights for Africa TIFA, which published the poll, told journalists that an opinion poll on trends in Coast and other parts of Kenya was conducted by her organisation between March 16 and March 18.', 'A GROUNDSWELL OF OPPOSITION ', 'On the face of it, Kabogo running against Baba Yao Waititu would have seemed set to cruise to victory as well. This was a Nairobi politician who had jumped over to Kiambu after losing his case against Evans Kidero in court. Plus he had nowhere near the resources available to Kabogo. Also Kabogo even had a development record of sorts, whereas Waititu was a garbage collector. He whitewashed Kabogo purely on the strength of effective negative propaganda.', 'Joho suffers from the same weakness that, although at this stage not visible, there is a groundswell of opposition against him that not even his party leader Raila will be able to save him from.', 'Although not given the lavish coverage that Joho himself gets, community leaders from key vote blocs in Mombasa county have in the past issued powerful statements denouncing Johos arrogance, inaccessibility and the governor using his time in office to expand his family business empire at the expense of other business communities such as the Kikuyu, Somali, Swahili/Arab and the Kamba.', 'This has led to a massive resistance among these communities not to accept five more years of a Joho family preponderance and monopoly over all the countys business opportunities.', 'Initially it seemed that the beneficiary of this trend would be Suleiman Shahbal, who lost to Joho in 2013, but performed credibly. Joho garnered 132,583 votes to Shahbals 94,905. But when the expected splintering of Cord did not materialize; when the key vote blocs of non-indigenous Mombasa residents  i.e. the Kamba, Luo, and Luhya  not only remained in Cord, but even expanded to become NASA; at that point it became clear that Shahbal riding on the Jubilee ticket had little chance of victory and that the candidate best-placed to defeat Joho is the only other politician in Mombasa who has won a countywide election  Senator Omar Hassan, popularly known in Mombasa as Sarai.', 'Somehow, none of this has been captured by the pollsters, just as the groundswell against Kabogo was detected only after the votes had been cast.', 'CASE STUDY: MUKHISA KITUYI vs MUSIKARI KOMBO', 'And yet the signs couldnt have been clearer. The fact is that being a major figure in a political coalition only counts if you are a party leader in your own right. Any other position does not translate directly into grassroots support. This phenomenon was most dramatically revealed in 2007, when two of the most senior politicians from Western Kenya  Cabinet ministers Mukisa Kituyi and Musikari Kombo  were fighting for supremacy in Bungoma, following the death of Ford Kenya Party leader and national Vice President Kijana Wamalwa.', 'Even as they went around the country campaigning with President Mwai Kibaki and attending to the details of their portfolios, and appearing to be utterly invincible in their backyards, they both ended up losing their parliamentary seats to previously unknown rivals. Indeed, this was the end of their political careers.', 'This is the bigger picture against which all the references to Joho being the coastal supremo; Amason Kingi being the runaway favourite of the Kilifi county race, and etc, need to be understood. ', 'THE RESULTS OF ANY KENYAN POLLSTER ARE TO BE TAKEN WITH A FISTFUL OF SALT', 'At some level, Kenyan voters are more possessive over their gubernatorial candidates than over their presidential candidates. They understand that their share of the development cake will come to them from the hand of their favoured governor candidate than from their favoured candidate for President. As such, the views of local grassroots leaders as to whom people will vote for carries more weight than a national image and dominance in media coverage.', 'Governor Joho, for example, has barely three weeks in which to regain the ground he has lost to Senator Omar and the fact that most MCAs currently serving in Mombasa on the ODM ticket have shifted to seeking the Wiper ticket to allow them to run as NASA candidates, but outside the ODM orbit. ', 'All this reveals clearly that when it comes to gubernatorial races, the results of any Kenyan pollster are to be taken with a fistful of salt. This is a tragic flaw because accurate polling has been a vital safety valve in Kenyan elections. Going all the way back to the 2005 National Referendum, Kenyas first, we have seen two referendums ( 2005 and 2010 ) and two presidential elections ( 2007 and 2013 ) in which the findings of the pollsters were broadly vindicated.', 'WE INEVITABLY END UP WITH A TWO-HORSE RACE', 'And even allowing for some doubtful tallying in these presidential elections, the indisputable fact still remains that a firm trend of Kenyan elections is that we inevitably end up with a two-horse race. These leading contenders each have the support of close to half the country.', 'The results therefore hinge on voter turnout along with the factor of whether or not there is a third candidate  for instance Kalonzo Musyoka in 2007 and Musalia Mudavadi in 2013.', 'The issue here is that accurate polls enable voters to reconcile themselves to potential outcomes such as that, for example, in the current presidential race, President Uhuru Kenyattas supporters should by now be aware of the very real possibility that he could be Kenyas first one-term President.', 'RAILA COULD LOSE FAIR AND SQUARE TO UHURU', 'By the same token, Raila and his hardcore supporters, for whom it is an article of faith that their man has been robbed of victory at least twice, must also reconcile themselves to the fact that if the Rift Valley remains 100 per cent loyal to Jubilee, and if JP supporters remain as disciplined and as committed as they were in 2013, then it is entirely possible that Raila could lose fair and square to Uhuru.', 'In that case, they will have no choice but to take solace in the thought that their man got to become one of only two Kenyan Prime Ministers, the other one having been Mzee Jomo Kenyatta in the period June 1, 1963 to December 12, 1964 and five years from now, when Uhuru is not a contender, he can play the role of State House kingmaker.', 'But leaving aside presidential politics, what about the counties? There may be enough evidence for those willing to look for it to suggest that Governor Joho will lose as badly on August 8 as Governor Kabogo did at the JP primaries. ', 'FEARS OVER POTENTIAL VIOLENCE HOTSPOTS', 'But neither Mombasa county nor Kiambu are viewed as potential violence hotspots. It is most unlikely that there will be violence in Kiambu if Baba Yao buries Kabogo in a landslide. Mombasa too will not have violence if Joho loses by a wide margin.', 'But what about those places which have been openly identified as political violence hotspots such as Marsabit, Tana River, Migori, Kisumu, and Narok counties, to name but a few?', 'For example, Governor Samuel Tunai is from a minority Maasai clan and had previously failed at every attempt to enter elective politics. Being on the Jubilee Party ticket in 2013, he benefitted from votes cast by the Kipsigis and Kikuyu voters of Narok. The majority Purko clan also presented him with three candidates who conveniently divided the Purko vote.', 'If we had accurate polls revealing to us who the likely winner was for the Narok county, then the voters there would have plenty of time to adjust to the likely outcome.', 'THE REAL SPARK FOR ELECTION VIOLENCE IN KENYA', 'We must bear it in mind that the real spark for election violence in Kenya and what then brings out whatever arrangements were made in advance for organising militia groups, is what we may define as the unpleasant surprise factor.', 'In 2007 the initial tallying of presidential votes seemed to favour Raila so strongly that the fact that his strongholds had been counted first did not register. When Kibakis strongholds were subsequently counted, even though the final results showed just what the pollsters had predicted, namely Kibaki and Raila with approximately 45 per cent each and Kalonzo with 10 per cent, nothing could appease the fury of Raila supporters who believed they had just witnessed daylight robbery of the presidential election.', 'It is true enough that American pollsters without exception predicted a Hillary Clinton victory over Donald Trump. The outcome defied the predictions but it is a sign of American maturity that, in a country with millions of firearms in private hands, there was no outbreak of politically inspired massacres in the wake of this totally unexpected result.', 'Kenyans may not have guns but in places like Tana River, Narok, Marsabit and Kilgoris, there are plenty of bows and arrows, spears and machetes and clubs.', 'So, the failure of Kenyan polling organisations as a distinct sector and the collapse of public confidence may well have tragic consequences as the results trickle out and confound the great expectations of an electorate that, at the county level, views the outcome as a matter of life and death.', '\n']"

He ruled for the state late on Thursday.', 'In the court filing, the Justice Department said the judge\'s ruling ""empties the (Supreme) Courts decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just close family members but virtually all family members.', 'The conservative-leaning Supreme Court is not currently in session but the justices can handle emergency requests. ', ""The administration's application could be directed either to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has responsibility for emergency requests from western states, or to the nine justices as a whole. If the court as a whole is asked to weigh in, five votes are needed to grant such a request."", '""The truth here is that the governments interpretation of the Supreme Courts stay order defies common sense,"" said Omar Jadwat, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union involved in challenging the ban. ""Thats what the district court correctly found and the attorney generals misleading attacks on its decision cant change that fact.""', 'In his decision, Watson harshly criticized the government\'s definition of close family relations as ""the antithesis of common sense.""', 'Watson also ruled that the assurance by a resettlement agency to provide basic services to a newly arrived refugee constitutes an adequate connection to the United States because it is a sufficiently formal and documented agreement that triggers responsibilities and compensation.', 'In the court filing, the Justice Department said Watson\'s ruling on refugees would make the Supreme Court\'s decision on that part of the executive order ""effectively meaningless.""', 'The ruling, if left in place, means refugees can continue to be resettled in the United States, beyond a cap of 50,000 set by the executive order. ', 'That limit was reached this week.', ""The Supreme Court's decision last month revived parts of Trump's March 6 executive order banning travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, as well as refugees for 120 days. The court also agreed to hear oral arguments in the fall over whether the ban violates the US Constitution. "", '\n']"
