While it is generally accepted that campaigns cost money, it is of note that the costs of running a campaign are ever increasing. To place this in perspective, as per the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets.org, the United States of Americas 2016 presidential and congressional elections carried a price tag of USD 6.5 Billion. Locally, the costs are also on the increase.', 'Due to the ever increasing capital intensive nature of political campaigns, it is no surprise that questions have been raised as to how these finances are raised, with a view to prevent the abuse of the electoral system for political/financial gain. It is with this in mind that the cry for regulatory reform in relation to campaign financing is prevalent, particularly in the African context. This is especially so because cost of campaigns continue to raise, amidst high poverty levels. The question of note being, what measures can be taken by various state actors to ensure that electoral malpractices such as corruption, bribery, vote buying and other election related financial malpractices do not fester in the electoral process thereby stymying the democratic process.', 'To this end, three particular objectives are quoted as being the basis of electoral reform: the need to: enhance transparency so as to preserve voters confidence; pursue equity in the electoral process so as to ensure a balanced playing field among parties and candidates; and assure accessibility to electoral competition for all citizens regardless of their financial status.', 'With this in mind, we must acknowledge that Kenya is indeed on track in relation to the regulation of political activities, and the attendant financing involved. The Constitution of Kenya, 2010, Article 88, gives the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission the mandate of conducting and supervising referenda and elections to any elective body or office established by the constitution and any other elections as prescribed by an Act of Parliament. Further, the Election Campaign Financing Act, 2013, provides for the regulation, management, expenditure and accountability of election campaign funds during election and referendum campaigns. On this basis, the IEBC, in pursuit of transparency, equity and accessibility in the electoral process, is required to regulate money spent by or on behalf of a candidate or political party in an election or referendum. Further, the same body is tasked with setting contribution and spending limits in relation to the same.', 'While it is evident that the legislative framework is in place, we must be cautious of creating discrepancies between the law and practice. For the existing legal framework to be effective, we as the electorate must ensure that we hold the existing parties and their campaign machinery to task. The electorate must go beyond being mesmerised by the candidates marketing gimmicks and focus on the manifestos and thereafter hold them to their promises.', '\n']"

The Head of Nairobis Inspectorate, Hillary Wambugu, was also one of the officials dismissed following the investigation. #InspectorFisi seems as if it might have even more heads rolling.', 'When looking into the finer details and numbers released by HUYO! and Africa Uncensored, the impact on the larger economy becomes clear. An estimated 80 per cent of Nairobis publicly commuting residents rely on privately owned mini-buses as their main mode of transportation, according to Quartz Africa. This creates a hugely lucrative sector, ripe for the picking by corrupt traffic officials posted at 45 places around Nairobi and various major transport hubs, such as bus and railway stations.', ' EASY TARGET', 'On a normal day, passengers from the outskirts of Nairobi are charged an average Sh100 for a one-way ride to or from the city centre. If one takes into account that there are over 30,000 matatus operating in Nairobi alone, with an occupancy of between 15 and 50 seats per vehicle, then its easy to see why this is such an easy target for traffic officers extorting bribes from operators.', 'This hustle is further exacerbated by the fact that Kenya is one of the only countries in East Africa that arrest drivers for even the most petty traffic offences. With the time and manpower needed for a traffic officer to arrest, impound, file paperwork and process each of the thousands of matatus stopped daily in disrepair or breaking the law, one could see how paying and taking a bribe seems like the less complicated solution. This furthermore creates a huge bottleneck in the countrys judicial system, just as it does in other African states like South Africa, says high court lawyer Richard Chemaly.', 'While the government needs to look as though theyre taking a hard stance on traffic offences  especially leading up to an election  this in reality has the opposite effect of efficient service delivery. The magistrate courts system, already stacked with major backlogs, are unnecessarily burdened with minor offences that could be resolved with a demerit point system or fines like Rwandas spot-fine system where an arrest is not necessary.', 'He further says that these stricter traffic laws also open up the playing field in the realities of day-to-day traffic and serious congestion for corruption as an alternative to stacks of paperwork for the average police officer and matatu driver.', 'Many police have become a law unto themselves, partly because this structure and system incentivises police to believe that taking a bribe still punishes the perpetrator but affords them gains in the process.', 'The implication from this statement is that if neither the drivers nor the officers want the burden of being dragged into the legal process of an arrest, this just creates a huge loophole in which one would not be surprised corruption was running rife. Many critics and local lawmakers believe this is the opposite effect of the zero-tolerance traffic system politicians like to advertise.', 'A large focus of the investigation is on the amount of money lost to corruption in the public transport sector. Africa Uncensoreds figures conservatively indicate a daily loss to corruption through traffic police bribes from matatu drivers at approximately Sh14.2 million a day in Nairobi alone. For the whole country, the figure climbs to over Sh2.13 billion a month and Sh26 billion lost to the traffic police annually.', 'ACTING WITH IMPUNITY', 'The investigation units editor and founder, John Allan-Namu, says the remaining two episodes will delve even deeper into the machinery behind the seamless and systematic ways in which Nairobi traffic officers solicit bribes from matatu drivers and the damage it does to Kenyan families who have lost loved ones in matatu accidents that could have been avoided if the police were doing their jobs.', 'The evidence is shocking and the impunity with which these officers collect bribes is even more shocking. Episode three will take the viewer deeper into the systems in place that take billions of shillings off the roads every year that should be improving our city, and the suffering and bloodshed this system has created for thousands of families, including mine, John says.', 'He adds that the timing of the investigation couldnt be better, with an estimated third of the countrys economy lost to corruption annually, according to Reuters, quickly becoming a big-ticket issue in the hotly contested elections scheduled for August 8.
