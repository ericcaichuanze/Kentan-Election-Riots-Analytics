Most importantly, incredibly ambitious and successful government infrastructure programmes have made Kenya a place where ease of doing business is increasing by the day.', 'Total national employment levels have been going up by 5.9 per cent annually, with almost a million jobs created in the formal and informal sectors every year. This inevitably leads to increased revenue collection (the highest in East Africa) and better government services.', 'Kenya is ranked as the second most attractive Foreign Direct Investment destination in Africa.

He even prides himself on his political ignorance, sticks out his chest and say he hates politics. The imbecile doesnt know that, from his political non-participation is born the prostitute, the abandoned child, and the worst thieves of all, the bad politician, corrupted and flunky of exploitative national and multinational companies.', 'Thus said Eugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht, a German philosopher who lived in the 19th century. But two decades later and several countries apart, his words can be used to describe the political situation in Kenya today.', 'Even though many Kenyans have listed up as voters and are excited to take part in the forthcoming elections, a spot-check on the streets by the Star returned a disgraceful verdict on the level of voter and political literacy.', 'Less than 25 days to the August 8 general election, most of those who signed up to take part in the election as voters had no idea of those vying for specific elective posts and processes on election day. Surprisingly, some candidates, too, could not give a clear explanation on the role of the posts they were seeking.', 'Tom Mogire, 34, a matatu driver plying the Kikuyu-Nairobi route, keeps quiet, reflects a bit, and scratches his head in an attempt to search for answers on who he will be voting for as his MCA, MP, woman representative and governor.', 'Hapo umenipata.

I will cast my vote for Uhuru Kenyatta as the President and anyone riding on a similar ticket, Abel Tarus, 27, who resides in Westlands, said as he disembarked at Delta House stage.', 'Before the promulgation of the 2010 constitution, voters on election date used to cast their vote only for the President, MP and councillor. Unlike then, where they used to get only three ballot papers, now under the devolved system, they receive six ballot papers for President, governor, senator, MP, woman representative and MCA.', 'At Kencom bus station, the situation is almost similar, with most of those we spoke to only mentioning Raila Odinga, Uhuru Kenyatta and a couple of some few governor candidates, but could barely list the other candidates for parliamentary and county assemblies in their respective constituencies.', 'They also remained clueless on how many electoral positions they will be casting votes in.', 'Despite knowing the frontrunners in the presidential race, all the respondents we spoke to had not interacted or even seen their manifestos and could not even mention what the candidates and their parties represents. They also had no clear information on what is expected of them as voters now and on election day.', 'NO CIVIC EDUCATION', 'Public ignorance on electoral processes, candidates and their roles a few days to the election is worrisome, electoral experts said. They blamed it on state institutions failure to conduct civic and voter education.', 'Lack of knowledge hinders voters ability to gauge the candidates, evaluate political viewpoints, understand how the government works and the processes in an electoral cycle, compromising their overall participation.', 'An uninformed voter is dangerous for our democracy and for the general good of our country. It is important for the population to internalise that we do elections to choose leaders to be in charge of resource production and distribution, Elections Observation Group coordinator Mule Musau said.', 'Willis Otieno, an advocate of the High Court and an election expert, said Kenya is where it is because civic and voter education have been abandoned.', 'Compared to previous elections, this is the worst, with a significant voter who is not educated on the entire election process. This cuts across those who have gone to school and hold degrees and those who havent, because all are politically illiterate, he said.', 'Brian Weke, an electoral expert, blames the low level of awareness on political and electoral processes on lack of prioritisation and belittling of the need for civic education.', 'You remember the President late last year himself dismissing the need for civic education, arguing that Kenyans know how to vote. What followed was a spirited attack on agencies that conducted civic education, and since then, there has been minimum civic education, Weke said.', 'He said the Malindi and other recent by-elections showed voter illiteracy is on an alarming increase.', 'With days to the election, most voters dont know that NASA wont be on ballot but it will be ODM [and other affiliate parties]. Others dont know whether they will use IDs or just biometrics, how many ballots papers they need and even how to mark them, Weke said.', 'VOTERS LATENT POWER', 'He reiterated that the illiteracy isnt confined to voters only. Candidates as well dont really comprehend the roles and powers in their areas of contention, saying this explains why many senators have refused to defend their seats in the Senate and opted for governor and MP seats.', 'For instance, the public still holds that MCAs are glorified councillors of the defunct municipal councils, he said.', 'An uninformed populace jeopardises the tenets of democracy, he said.', 'Otieno said the situation will compromise accountability at local and national levels, as the public doesnt know what to expect from its leaders.', 'What happened in 2013 is that the election came on the heels of the new constitution, which had been highly marketed through intense civic engagement, creating a sense of enlightenment in voters. But now we are experiencing a total lapse, Otieno said.', 'He said the IEBC and the government should play their part in voter education and civic education.', 'Otieno said the commission should take advantage of the voters mood to go flat out and carry out massive voter education to salvage the situation. Otherwise, we might see a low voter turnout, and those who will line up on election date will cast their votes wrongly, thus leading to many spoilt votes.', 'Mule said vigorous voter education by the IEBC is necessary and urgent, but the long-term solution is national political education.', 'Beyond voter education that is desperately needed for the elections to come, Kenyans need a deep understanding of the power they have and the responsibility or civic duties of the politicians, he said.', 'The media is doing well in profiling some of the candidates to help them make choices, but that is not enough, as we have over half of the voters with no knowledge on electoral process. Most Kenyans think it is okay to receive bribes from the politicians because they dont understand that receiving the bribes is illegal.', 'Weke urged the IEBC to fund and work with non-state actors with grassroots reach to help raise awareness.

They could be undecided because none of the candidates have provided enough reasons to attract their support. They need to be persuaded who is the lesser of two evils. Data has shown that undecided voters are generally less interested in politics, are not interested in the news, tend to be younger, have lower levels of education and are predominantly women voters.

Many have thus continued to either defend or condemn David Ndii for his prediction that Kenya would burn if President Uhuru Kenyatta was elected in a sham election but there has, sadly, been relatively little discussion of how the burning can be avoided.', ' ', 'Part of the dilemma is that we seem to have painted ourselves into a lexical corner. Today, the public discourse appears to equate resistance with violence and burning, and the maintenance of what President Kenyatta called, in his inauguration speech, a perfunctory peace with acquiescence and silence.', ' ', 'This was evident in the online reaction to the sentiments of yet another public figure, this time from the Jubilee neck of the woods. The melodramatics of her video and tenuous grasp of South African history aside, Julie Gichuru had made some valid points on Twitter about the merits of committing to non-violence and got pummeled for it. Partly, I suppose, this was a reaction to her as opposed to her message. She, after all, was one of the stalwarts of the 2013 accept and move on brigade and perhaps this was seen as a continuation of that campaign.', ' ', 'Yet, as she correctly says in one tweet, This is not Justice v Peace. Seek justice through non violent means. And in another, It is key to reject the normalisation of violence to achieve ends. NonViolent Action is harder but protects the most vulnerable. It is just.', ' ', 'Despite the abandon with which some talk of the country burning, I doubt many Kenyans on either side of the political divide, who lived through the violence of 2008, are anxious for a repeat. Even those, like me, who believed (and still believe) that Mwai Kibaki stole the election did not consider that a justification for the violence that followed. In fact, up till the unfortunate politicising of the cases at the International Criminal Court, there was massive support among ordinary Kenyans on the need to bring those responsible to book.', ' ', 'Ironically, we all seemingly want to avoid a 2008-style conflagration but appear to think we do that by avoiding a discussion about it. Yet it is crucial that we engage in a serious discussion about how we respond to the actions of the political class and of the government they control, especially in the case of a disputed poll. I propose three NOs: NO acceptance, NO violence, NO forgetting.', ' ', 'First, I am encouraged that many are explicitly rejecting the accept and move on message that permeated the 2013 election, which encouraged people to silence their doubts about the election for the sake of peace. There must be no acceptance of a fraudulent election. The insistence must be on the IEBC delivering the free, fair and credible election it is required to by the Constitution. Kenyans must not be scared off making such demands by the fearmongering of those who assert that the August 8 date is set in stone. The country still has the options it did in the last election (remember, the election was held in March, not August) and better to delay the election, if necessary, than to conduct a sham one on time.', ' ', 'Secondly, in the not unlikely case of a disputed poll, there must also be also commitment, by those who feel aggrieved, to exclusively use non-violent means of resistance and to avoid a repeat of the scenes of 2008. Concurrently, the government must also undertake to respect the rights of all Kenyans to peacefully express any dissatisfaction they may have with the conduct of the election, as it is required to do by the Constitution. We must not forget that the government has historically demonstrated little tolerance for peaceful citizen action. There must be no blanket bans on public demonstrations or their violent disruption as has happened after nearly every election. There must be no resort to tear gas, water cannon, truncheons and bullets to meet peaceful protests.', ' ', 'Finally, there must be commitment to exorcise the ghosts of the past. Regardless of the outcome of the election and whether that outcome is disputed, there is to be no return to business-as-usual. Kenyans must collectively demand that the TJRC report is implemented and that we finally have the long overdue and uncomfortable conversations with the past that we have been avoiding for the last half century.', '\n']"

They have been forced to piggy-back on community activities such as barazas and civil society events to facilitate the dissemination of their messaging, she said.', 'Okaya said recent changes to electoral laws have brought a new demographic of voters  prisoners. This requires a special and comprehensive initiative, particularly by the IEBC, to take voter and civic education to prisons (if this has happened, our observers are not aware of it, she said).', 'This is critical. If prisoners are to come into the electorate fold, they should still be able to make informed decisions and without duress, she said.

For instance at the moment, we cant produce voter education on technology because it keeps mutating. The reason there have been delays is because we want to be certain that all issues around laws and processes are thrashed out, he said.', 'Masudi said already, they have media strategies that will use infomercials in print media, radio and TV documentaries, talk shows, and social media engagement. These will be rolled out starting next week to educate the public on elective seats and their mandates, the technology to be used, voting processes and post-voting activities.', 'He said they have deployed 3,237 voter educators around the country (2,900 one in each ward, 290 for constituencies and 47 at counties).Together with another over 200 accredited voter education partners or providers, we are going to use various community forums, chief barazas and even parents meetings to conduct voter education, he said.', 'He said education on voter registration, verifications and party primary-nominations (in which they didnt fully participate) had ended. The next phase will include education on date of election and what a voter is expected to carry to the polling station.', 'We will be telling voters to carry either the ID or passport that was used to register as voters, and we no longer need a voters card or an acknowledgement script, he said.', 'Then voters will be taught on elective positions, agreed technology on voter identification and result transmission. Towards the end of the voter education period, we will concentrate on ballot education.', 'We will be doing trials and demos on how to mark the ballots and explain what goes on after the closure of polling stations, to try and demystify past mysteries that have surrounded tallying of results, he said.', '\n']"
