', 'Some medieval recipes to treat infertility in men were devised, including catmint-boiled wine and ground up pig testicles in wine. ', 'The analysis of medical and religious texts from the 13th century, conducted by researchers at the University of Exeter, showed that some of the texts discussing male infertility were widely circulated. ', ""According to the researchers, it's been widely assumed that women in medieval England were blamed for a couple not having children, and that religious preaching about infertility focused on women. "", ""It's also been assumed that when men were considered responsible for a couple not being able to have children, it was because of sexual dysfunction, where the man was unable to have an erection and have intercourse. "", 'Dr Catherine Rider, a historian at the University of Exeter involved with the study, said: ""Although medical texts tended to devote most space to female infertility, male infertility was nonetheless regularly discussed as a possible cause of childlessness in academic texts and by educated medieval medical practitioners, and this information may have been used on occasion when treating childless couples.

', 'Dr Rider found that doctors at the time recogniSed that sexually-active men might not be able to conceive a child.', 'In 13th-15th century England, male infertility was viewed as a possibility not only among people who studied medicine and could read Latin, but also among less-educated people who read English texts. ', 'Latin texts were translated, adapted and added to, influencing English recipe collections which include infertility medicine concoctions. ', ""For example, a 12th century gynaecological book called 'The Trotula,' written by an anonymous author, was circulated widely and translated into English and French. "", 'It said that ""conception is impeded as much by the fault of the man as by the fault of the women"".', 'LESS VISIBLE FORMS OF STERILITY', ""The widely read book also described male reproductive disorders being about less visible forms of 'sterility' as well as problems relating to erections and sperm emissions.

"", 'The remedy detailed that both the man and the woman should each urinate in a pot of bran, and the pots should be left for nine or ten days. ', 'If worms appeared in one of the pots, than that person was the infertile partner. ', ""Another medical text, written by John of Mirfield, a cleric associated with St Bartholomew's Hospital in London in the late 14th century, warned: 'It should be noted that when sterility happens between married people, the males are accused by many people of not having suitable seed,'"", 'Some medieval medical books also had advice for men to improve their fertility. ', ""For example, The Liber de Diversis Medicinis (Book of Diverse Medicines), a collection of medical recipes from the 15th century, said: 'If a man wishes that a woman will conceive a child soon take catmint and boil it with wine until it is reduced to a third of its original volume, and give it to him to drink on an empty stomach for three days.'"", 'Another recipe book, located in the Wellcome Library in London, advised that to stop sterility, a person should: ""Take a pig\'s testicles, dry and grind them, and give them to drink with wine for three days.""', ""However, it wasn't clear if the man or woman was supposed to drink the remedy.

', 'Dr Rider also found evidence of men being accused of impotence in church courts, but medical ideas about male reproductive disorders went beyond the idea of just impotence.

Now in its seventh season, the various plot twists and turns, the rise and fall of the fortunes of characters keeps me glued to the TV whenever its on. Missing any of the weekly episodes, or even having to wait months for the next season to start is an anathema.', 'In a way, my angst is reflected in the reactions this week to President Uhuru Kenyattas decision to skip the Presidential Debates. Politics is Kenyas version of Westeros, complete with skullduggery, moral nudity, incestuous liaisons and, of course, a throne all covet, fear or manipulate.', 'We revel in the gladiatorial contests for power between scions of political dynasties, in the intrigues and betrayals, in the gore and mayhem. As I have written before, and as was reiterated by Dr Wandia Njoya in this weeks edition of the Cheche show on Citizen TV, our politics is a show put on by politicians that has little to do with addressing the everyday struggles of ordinary folks. In fact, it is meant to distract attention from those very problems.', 'There is an implicit compact. We will be content to ignore the fundamental questions and issues facing our polity so long as our politicians do the dance. The rhetorical contests of election campaigns, manifestos and TV debates are the stuff of this performance, which plays out on our TV screens and on political daises across the nation. It is this compact that President Uhuru Kenyatta violated.', 'What was promised was a no-holds barred, blood-on-the-floor cage match, with the media providing the stage and acting as both promoter and referee. After weeks of priming and waiting, we had taken our ringside seats, enjoyed the curtain raiser in the form of the debate between three of the other six candidates and were waiting for the headline event, which was to pit the President against his main challenger, Raila Odinga.', 'Thus the disappointment and anger was palpable, even within supporters of his Jubilee Party, when the reigning champion failed to turn up.', 'What we instead got was a tepid performance of shadow-boxing, where Raila, alone on stage, ducked, weaved and parried the moderators poor attempts to pin him down. ', 'In the end, we learnt little that was of value, that we didnt already know. But that is not why we were there. Few in the audience were particularly interested in the intricacies of policy and in understanding how NASA or Jubilee would pay for the fantastical promises of brand-new stadia, roads and free everything. We wanted blood and gore and broken teeth and spilled guts.', 'This is the show we had paid for with our stolen taxes and our enduring poverty and oppression. It is what we had sacrificed our pensions, health and childrens future for. And wed been had. We were left feeling short-changed and vented our rage in bars, meeting places, on TV screens and on social media, always careful to couch it in the acceptable language of accountability.', 'We have, we will keep saying disingenuously, been denied the opportunity to question our leaders, to hold them to account, to understand the issues on which the campaigns are supposedly being waged. ', 'But this is not true and we know it. The manifestos are online if we want to interrogate them. Nothing stops us debating the issues and demanding that the media reflect them in the questions they pose to candidates and politicians and not be fobbed off with non-answers. The truth is we had been denied a show, a performance.', 'What we should ponder is less whether the President should have turned up and more why we engage in this charade. Politics and political debates should be about much more than entertainment and should definitely be about finding real solutions to our very real problems. Not a distraction from them. We already have Game of Thrones for that.', '\n']"

Kenyas capital has been water-rationed since January 1, and it is not impossible that it might run dry by September. Rain is not expected until October and cannot be counted on. The previous two seasons were dismal.', '\n', 'For residents of the city of 3.3 million, what might happen is so beyond their control that most bat the thought away and soldier on, storing water in jerry cans when taps flow. But for the Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company (NWSC), it is a spectre that haunts them. On July 14, Nairobi City County declared a cholera outbreak, citing among the causes irregular supply of potable water. How bad might this get?', '\n', 'At the end of every rainy season I have excess water, but this year No. Were only 37 per cent full, says Job Kihamba, who manages Ndakaini, the storage dam that traps three rivers that flow down from the Abedare Range and releases the water in the dry season. The NdakainiNgethu system accounts for 85 per cent of Nairobis water. Every day the engineer measures what comes in, what leaves and the safety of the dam wall.', '\n', 'It has been a rocky 12 months. The rains in October-December last year delivered just 268mm, compared to about 700mm expected from rainfall patterns in recent years. Then in 2017, the March-May rains were late. When I visited Ndakaini with colleagues from the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) on April 25, the reservoir was just 20 per cent full, an unprecedented low. We blinked in the sun, gazed at the exposed mud, and, looking towards the city, thought: Who down there knows?', '\n', 'Finally, the rains came on May 1 but delivered just 440mm of the 1,000mm expected. Today the Chania and Sasumua, two of the rivers that supply the city, resemble streams more than rivers. The water available to the city has plummeted. Nairobis water company is distributing 400,000 cubic metres a day, 150,000 less than it used to and 350,000 less than the city needs; 60 per cent of the population lacks reliable water.', '\n', 'Of 78 public boreholes, only 48 are working. Nairobi used to be a swamp but is no longer behaving like one. Our underground rivers have dried up, says engineer Lucy Macharia, environment and compliance manager of the NCWSC. Swamps are the recharge areas, but they have been built upon. The county is attempting to address this but is overwhelmed by urbanisation and the need for housing.', '\n', 'POWERFUL SOLUTIONS', '\n', 'If water is scarce, however, she and other experts have no shortage of powerful solutions. Among them are things that can be done in the city, such as rainwater harvesting from buildings and deliberate efforts to cause groundwater recharge. The latter would include storm water management and pumping the 115,000 cubic metres of waste water that the company treats daily back into the ground for eventual reuse.', '\n', 'But the most important route, they all say, is to care for the land. The catchment is my next God, Kihamba says. Without it, Im done. The Upper Tana catchment spans 970,000ha and must also supply water to millions of rural residents within it and millions more along the Tana river, as it wends its way down to the Indian Ocean. It consists of small towns, tea estates and an estimated 300,000 small farms, many of which supply food to the city.', '\n', 'What we are seeing here is a broken loop between how a city reconciles its thirst for water and its hunger for food, observes Spanish resilience expert Arturo Getz Escudero. Cities can reward farmers for behaviours such as preventing erosion.', '\n', 'There are signs that is already happening. Fred Kihara runs the Nairobi Water Fund, a partnership between The Nature Conservancy, the government, large water users such as NCWSC, Kenya Electricity Generating Company, Coca-Cola and East Africa Breweries, donor International Fund for Agriculture, NGOs such as the Green Belt Movement, researchers, and others.', '\n', 'Modelled on Latin American schemes, it provides farmers with training, resources and equipment to preserve river health, conserve water and reap the benefits of higher crop yields and more stable farms. Theres no contract or cash transfer, Kihara says.', '\n', 'In five years, with 15,000 farmers, we have increased the flow to Nairobi by 27,000 cubic metres a day. We dont compel, we socially persuade. Most of it is terracing, sediment trapping, planting 200,000 trees a season. The deal is you can keep the soil on your land with this good quality Napier grass that we supply you. We aim for three metres of permanent vegetation on river banks. What you want is to reduce the pace of the water. The main aim is get the rivers clean and improve flow.', '\n', '\n', 'CLIMATE CHANGE', '\n', 'But the multiplicity of challenging trends  climate change (which, besides causing droughts, intensifies floods), the needs of a booming city, a growing rural populace, and hundreds of thousands of still-unreached farmers  means the crisis is still not being addressed in its full gravity. People are farming without soil and water conservation structures. Restoration of lands outside forest areas is a must, says Oscar Simanto of the Kenya Forest Service.', '\n', 'We must restore forest cover over the main lower catchment area, says director of Mpala Research Centre, ecologist Dino Martins. This is the more moist forest zone that has been destroyed. It is shocking that any agriculture should be taking place on the steep slopes around the dam at all, to be frank. The only way to secure the water supply for the people of Nairobi  soon to be 20 million  is through making some strong decisions that bring back forest cover around the entire dam. Other cities like Boston have done this successfully and now have enough water for their people and industries.', '\n', 'It needs more than we are doing, says engineer Njambi. It is time for best practices. But the land is mostly private, and private land is the most difficult. Farmers look at economic benefits. If it is eucalyptus, theyll do that. If it is beans, theyll do that. When it rains, the water gushes down, causing damage. Eucalyptus reduces water speed a little, but it does not seep in because of the leaves. We cant dictate to farmers what to do. But we need ways to put water into the ground.', '\n', 'Besides small farmers, estates must step up, too. Tea is promoted as a perennial that benefits farmers and keeps the ground covered. But under the tea, the soil is panned, Njambi says.', '\n', 'Dr Ravi Prabhu, deputy director general of ICRAF, says: This can be managed by growing legumes or building contour strips.', '\n', 'ICRAF is measuring the relationship between organic matter in the soil and the extent that water infiltrates into the ground in the valleys and hills. It has researched financial incentives to nudge sustainable land management. With the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, it found that 40 per cent of water users in the city of Nairobi are willing to pay an incremental $1.25 (Sh125 ) over their tariffs for watershed management. This could go to pay farmers for the environmental services they generate like increased water supplies.', '\n', 'CAPITAL LOAN', '\n', 'Green loans and training help, too. Peter Karanja, 70, farms near Sasumua and received a working capital loan from climate smart credit company, F3Life, the terms of which held him to conserve soil and water. He used it to buy a cow. Galvanised by the loan and trained by ICRAF to plant trees and Napier grass to prevent erosion, but also create more revenue streams on his farm, Karanja swung into action to restore its ecological health, earn more and do right by the watershed. Fed on the grass, the cow has produced offspring and piles of manure. Deep and rich behind bunds, little soil now erode from his land. Karanjas income has grown. But he needs better markets for his pears and plums.', '\n', 'Its finding the high-value tree species that have the hydrological properties you want, says ICRAFs Fergus Sinclair.', '\n', 'Ellis Jones and Obadiah Ngigi, co-founders of F3Life, which reached 75 farmers in the Nairobi catchment and plans to scale up to thousands more, say: We are really excited about the potential for eco-credit to drive the restoration of water catchments on a sustainable financial basis.', '\n', 'Cities are greedy gulpers of water. Research by Rob McDonald at The Nature Conservancy found that urban areas only cover 2-4 per cent of the earths land surface, but that the area upstream of their water sources, their water footprint, covers an astounding 41 per cent of the earths surface. Nairobis story is echoed in water-stressed cities around the world.', '\n', 'Nairobi abounds with the energy of entrepreneurs, from the jua kali (hot sun) workers, to the digital global trendsetters in their air-conditioned offices. But the lack of water is everyones crisis. It wont be easy to replenish and sustain this essential resource. ICRAFs Dr Prabhu is cautiously optimistic, however, saying that if the people of Kenya pull together, the issue can be solved. There is growing political will, and investments have started to flow. What is required is social capital from watershed to water user, and this situation could be turned around.', '\n', 'A shorter version of this article appeared in The Guardian on July 18. Cathy Watson is the chief of programme development at the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF)', '\n']"

Competence in managing elections is a gradual process that, with each passing election, lays the foundation upon which future capabilities are built.', 'The longer the experience the greater the accumulated stock of knowledge and competence. Glossing over or uncritically evaluating past mistakes is as dangerous as failing to critically acclaim past successes. Some lessons from 2013 include:', 'There was between average to poor performance of the Evids. The IEBC (the former director of ICT) has said the kits worked 47 per cent.). This was dismal. The main or only reason for this was power management failure. Demystified of its technical cloak, this means battery charging and allied technical tasks flopped.', 'This was not a procurement issue because the same equipment was used with absolute success in all the by-elections between 2013 and 2016. The highly acclaimed Ghanaian Electoral Commission used similar Evids in the 2012 General Election, and here too they collapsed.', 'The Ghanaian response to this crisis was for the commission to extend the election by one day, whereupon the equipment worked successfully after the battery matter was resolved. In Kenya we reverted to the manual process', 'And here lies lesson one for the current IEBC team. The IEBC leadership of 2013, including this author, regarded the technology as infallible or fail proof. And when it failed, we failed to proactively alert the voting public and key stakeholders promptly and to use every available mass communication infrastructure to explain both the cause of the failure and the use of the alternative manual system as remedy.', 'This raised well-deserved suspicion and created a conduit for mischief for those with the inclination and means. I cringe every time some hapless IEBC ICT manager and clueless commissioner say on national television with absolute assurance that nothing can go wrong, and that the alternative available in case one technology fails is more of the same technology.', 'The second lesson is the nation must trust or have some confidence in its Election Management Body. This translates into statutory electoral law that grants some operational discretion, even if well circumscribed, to the EMB. Attempts to regulate every conceivable critical detail by law result not necessarily in operational effectiveness, just greater cost.', 'The third lesson is that this trust is earned the hard way, by greater openness, accountability and above all fierce and unimpeachable neutrality by the top leadership of the EMB.', 'The Economist concluded, after a lengthy report on the last Nigerian election, that traditionally all major parties try to rig elections (the Kriegler Commission, IREC report concur), but the one reason the Nigerian parties and the state did not try to manipulate the last election was the uncompromising and well-demonstrated fearless neutrality of the chairman, Prof Attahiru Muhammadu Jega.', 'The same goes for the venerable chairman of the Ghanaian body. Greater public confidence in the EMB in turn empowers it to make difficult choices and stand up to the rigging instincts of the state.', 'Fourth lesson: Biometric Voter Registration was massively successful. The commission, however, had serious technical challenges in building a single register. There were many reasons for this, including a lack of an integrated national civil population register with births, deaths and voters, etc.', 'Cleaning the register of dead voters was, and still is, a nightmare. Duplication or removing double registrants was, and still will be, an inexact activity, meaning the register will have such entries.', 'The lesson is that we neglected to highlight these to the wider public and to be transparent about the scope of the problem. Greater and unsolicited openness and fulsome engagement with the key stakeholders would have generated empirical solutions, including drawing a list of signals to watch out for in case these faults were being abused.', 'Very few countries have totally unadulterated voter registers. Their answer is greater transparency and accountability and massive investment in civic education.', 'Ballot paper acquisition was done expertly with close and continuous engagement with the Public Procurement And Oversight Board. All known potential vendors were, in one way or another, involved, thus going beyond what the law required. The adjudicated price was the lowest any vendor could provide.', 'Those who felt aggrieved went to the Public Procurement Disputes Review Tribunal and the courts and lost in both. Timing is of the essence for such a contract award; not too early (this is prone to suspicion, we are in Kenya, after all) and not too late. This is lesson five.', ""Lesson six relates to the humiliating collapse of the results transmission system. We had invited political parties to send ICT representatives to Bomas and in some earlier demonstrations. We had IFES (the International Foundation for Electoral Systems) as the commission's accredited ICT adviser."", 'The IFES gave unequivocal assurance to the commission that a collapse or major disruption in the RTS was inconceivable, given the multiple layers of preventive actions already inbuilt in the system. The ICT credentials of the IFES were and are unimpeachable. It has advised many EMBs on ICT intervention in elections.', 'Lessson: Bindu Bichenjanga. No ICT system built by man cannot be breached. And when this happens Kenyans will be keen to know the possible perpetrator. The IEBC chairman should take heed.', 'Lesson seven: Eschew the laager mentality. For extended periods ,The Issack Hassan/James Oswago IEBC soaked endless public adulation. We became entitled. Any critique, however genuine, was ascribed to malevolent internal and external forces and agents of doom: Ask Dr Nyakuri Baraza!', 'When genuine criticism occurred, for example over the ignoble and aborted procurement of BVR kits (before the government intervened and procured the same at over twice the original price), or when well-founded critical issues arose subsequent to the 2013 election, the commission built a laager mentality.', 'External criticism immediately after the election was seen as the work of losers, an unfortunate term beloved by the victors in that contest. Instead of embracing criticism, even if fickle, and engaging critics in constructive and open discourse, commissioners (some) became openly hostile to contrary opinions and saw critics as idlers filled with envy and political hate. Even internal dissent was censured.', 'This hubris and lack of wisdom soon ballooned into something monstrous that consumed the commissioners. Lesson; those who wield monopoly power are the last to realise they have lost it.', 'Chebukati should learn to listen, and share information, even that which is critical of him, with the public. Admit, openly, when mistakes occur and never shun taking responsibility. Your key constituency is the Kenyan masses. No single political formation can intimidate you when your public job approval rating is stratospheric.', ""Remember to moderate public expectations instead of raising them. It's reckless, as one of your more vocal commissioners is fond of, to say with finality and absolute certainty that nothing can ever go wrong."", 'Lastly, while on this, never pretend to be an elections management expert. You are not; well, not yet.', 'Lesson eight: Only the paranoid survive. Election management in Kenya is a thankless vocation. Major stakeholders, particularly political parties, security formations, the civil service, etc, desire nothing more than to subvert the will of the people.', 'In plain language, anybody and everybody in power, except a minuscule few, mostly want to rig the election in their favour.', ""Be very afraid. None before you as chairman, from Justice Zaccheus Chesoni, understood state power. It's easy to become a hapless pawn, nay, a puppet, with horrid personal consequences. This applies equally to commissioners and senior staff."", 'Lastly, lesson nine. One enduring legacy of 2013 is the spectre of procurement corruption. Some of the managers of that era, including the undersigned, are in court facing corruption-related charges, including the much-hyped ChickenGate, which at Sh30 million (and it becomes zero when the agent is paid his legitimate commission) is truly chickenfeed, even if true.', ""It's not in the league of Goldernberg, NYS, Youth Fund, etc. Your predecessor stated unequivocally that not a single cent of public money was lost. Subsequent multiple audits by the Auditor General, without even bothering to interview any of the four senior-most officers in the procurement chain and who are already arraigned in court, has found some lapses in procurement, but not a single lost coin of public money."", 'Lesson: Time might come when power wielders prescribe sacrifices as public catharsis. This is done as atonement and to neutralise massive public anger at some perceived shortcoming of the electoral commission, especially where there is suspicion of state complicity.', 'This becomes necessary in order to distance state power from collateral damage and to deflect attention. Ask Kivuitu or Hassan. Ooh, remember this.', '\n']"
