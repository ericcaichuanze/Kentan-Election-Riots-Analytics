Really, the menu is so extensive that you will simply be spoilt for choice. A breakfast fry up, stuffed barbecued pork chops with apple sauce, premium aged beef so tender it will come apart like butter, salads, vegetarian options, a dessert menu that will temporarily knock out your no-sugar diet (theres even a Kenyan cheeseboard, for all you cheese lovers out there), digestifs, boozy coffee or hot chocolate, and much more.', 'If you fancy a nice fine dining experience with friends, family or business mates, About Thyme dishes it out just like I like it.

Many people have their reservations about how\ndevolution has worked out, with particular concerns about devolving corruption.\nBut surveys have generally shown considerable enthusiasm on the part of\nKenyans. In September last year, an Ipsos poll showed that enthusiasm was\ngreatest in Nyanza where 86 per cent of people were supportive. Even in the\nleast supportive areas, sizeable majorities approved: 64 per cent in Central\nand 74 per cent in the Rift Valley.', ' ', 'It is hardly surprising that all manifestos\nprofess support for devolution, saying they would strengthen it.

Recognising diversity and protecting the rights of\nminorities and marginalised communities, and thus strengthening national unity,\nare prominent among the aims. So are promotion of service delivery, and social\nand economic development, and fairness in the sharing of resources. More transparency\nin government and more accountability are also important. ', ' ', 'The methodology is enhanced democracy,\nparticularly locally, through involving the people in government, and in\ndecisions that are important to them. And this is done by the creation of\ngovernments at the county level, elected by the people and accountable to them.\nThose governments have responsibility for many activities that are central to\npeoples daily lives, such as health, local transport, agriculture, markets and\nsmall businesses, local roads, water supply and sanitation. To carry out the\nresponsibilities they are to have adequate financemost of which comes from the\nresources raised by national government, but they have certain powers to raise\nmoney themselves, and the financing arrangements are to be designed to\nencourage this.

In theory, by now counties are exercising all those\npowers. Jubilee considers that all functions have been transferred ', ' ', 'NASA, however, believes that counties are not\nyet able to carry out all the functions that were intended to be devolved to\nthem (though it does not list these). It, therefore, proposes to ensure that\nall functions are indeed transferred. In fact, it intends to pass legislation\nto clarify the allocation of powers, and also to transfer responsibility for\ninfrastructure for public primary and secondary school to counties. It does not\nclearly explain why. The Council of Governors annual devolution conference in\n2016 said, County planning and development for electricity and gas\nreticulation [distribution networks], energy regulation and cultural\nactivities, for instance public entertainment and public amenities such as libraries,\nhave not been fully transferred.', ' ', 'NASA also proposes that various existing bodies\nthat carry out functions that now straddle the powers of both national and\ncounty governments should be reorganised to ensure that they fit with the new\nsystem.

The 34\nper cent Jubilee mentions is of the 2013-14 financial years money.', ' ', 'NASA, on the other hand, argues that various\nstrategies have been used to reduce funds to counties, and commits itself to\nensuring that the principle of funds follow function is observed. Wisely, it\ndoes not commit itself to a minimum of 45 per cent of national revenue to go to\ncounties  as it did in the Okoa Kenya campaign in 2015.

These are not cheap. It is true we\nought to be spending more on some county matters, especially health. As a country\nwe joined others in Africa to commit to spending 15 per cent of our overall\nbudget on health, but now we spend more like five per cent. ', ' ', 'The important issue is to do as NASA says  ensure\nthat we start with the functions and then ask how much they cost. It is also\nimportant that counties make efforts to raise their own revenues. When county\nresidents feel counties are spending their money they should be more determined\nto hold the county governments accountable  achieving some of the important\nobjectives of devolution.', ' ', 'NASA also promises to change the Constitution\nto ensure that counties and communities share benefits from resources.

It is important to remember that counties are\nnot local governments in the old sense  subject to the whims of the Minister\nof Local Government and liable to be sacked or sidelined at any moment. Though\ngovernments are inter-dependent they are also distinct. This means they\nmust be able to make their own decisions  otherwise, how can they be\naccountable to those who elected them?', ' ', 'It is not clear how far Jubilees promises are\ndesigned to strengthen counties. It speaks of a structured system of\nconditional grants. Though they say this would enable counties to enhance\ncapacity to raise their own revenues, drive investment to national priority\nareas and strengthen their organisational capabilities  valid aims  it is not\nclear how. Conditional grants take decision making out of the hands of\ncounties, weakening rather than strengthening them and their accountability.', ' ', 'The Jubilee approach smacks rather of doing\nthings to or for counties, rather than with them. This is true also of their one-county-one-product\nprogramme intended to promote development of industries in each county based\non products and resource potential that are unique to each county. Is this\nbased on reality? And how does it strengthen devolution?', ' ', 'Both main manifestos seem to have little idea\nof how the national and county governments are supposed to interact when it\ncomes to specific programmes. NASAs extensive plans for agriculture  much of\nwhich is a county function  do not mention county governments once. Jubilee\ndoes not mention counties in connection with plans to increase access to\nsanitation and sewerage by an additional 500,000 households by  also county\nfunctions. It does say it will work with county governments when it comes to establishing\nproper waste management systems.', ' ', 'It seems there is some way to go before\ndevolution is fully understood and internalised.

Now Im no expert, but going by that logic, what conventional wisdom is trying to tell us is that because the Attorney General, Inspector General of Police, and all the Cabinet Secretaries were not elected by the people, they are therefore not accountable to the people of Kenya and can do whatever they want. What folly.', 'If we turned a deaf ear to conventional wisdom, it would dawn on us that an elected official, a politician, cannot effectively manage this city. I mean look at the place, it is diverse, with varying constituent interests. The residents concerned about carbon emissions, commuter trains, and road network accessibility to 5-Star restaurants are not the same residents who would like to continue conducting business on the road, or pick up and drop off passengers in the middle of the street. How can a politician possibly manage this eclectic bunch, make tough decisions where they need to be made? He cant, because ultimately, decisions made by a politician are based on how it affects his political career, and his chances of re-election. And if youre going to effectively run this city, know that whatever decisions you make, someone will be upset; either a potential voter or a potential contributor to your re-election fundraising event.', 'As for an administrator, his job is not to be popular but to administer, bring order where necessary, effect policy where needed. Unlike an elected governor, whose life depends on votes, an appointed administrator would not give a hoot how many boda boda riders would be unhappy because they cant ride on the wrong side of the road, even if there are thousands of them with voters cards.', 'But, Im just whistling in the wind here. Conventional wisdom always prevails.', 'It would be nice, though, stepping out of these echo chambers we like living in to get some fresh air now and then.', '\n']"

It is even worse when the government itself perpetrates this fear. ', 'It was a very big mistake for the Inspector General of Police to release a statement saying that the state is ready to deal ruthlessly with any troublemaker during this election. ', 'A terrifying picture was published on the front page of a daily newspaper showing the IG armed to the teeth, ready to crush any troublemaker at election time. ', 'It was like getting ready to kill a fly with a sledgehammer!', 'The consequence of all this was fear in multi-ethnic cities and towns such as Kisumu. ', 'Since my dear home city had been identified by the same government as a potential hotspot, so-called minority communities immediately went into a panic after the IGs statement. ', 'A group of resident Asian friends invited me to a club and asked me to reassure them regarding their safety at election time. ', 'One of them told me that his family has established a tradition of sending all members of the family on holiday abroad around election period. ', 'The others told me they would close their businesses very early and stay indoors and wait and see what happens. ', 'In effect, there was going to be a business slow down two weeks ahead of the election. ', 'The African workers who registered as voters in Kisumu but come from afar were also likely to go home during the polls to avoid being trapped in any trouble. ', 'I was further taken aback when the 23,000 strong Gusii community, most of whom live in the Nyamasaria neighbourhood of Kisumu, also were panicked after Boinnets statement. ', 'Criminal and opportunistic elements started warning some of them to take care because we too are coming for you. ', 'The daily newspaper that starred the IG on its front page had the caption, Get ready: We are coming for you. ', 'This caption/headline went viral among criminals and hoodlums who thrive on fear to advance their business. ', 'In the Nyamasaria neighbourhood they capitalised on it. It took the initiative of the Gusii leaders to call a meeting of community leaders at the Royal Dubai Hotel, where I was the keynote speaker, to address this issue and put it to rest. ', 'The community resolved to stay put during the election, and avoid depressing the NASA voter turnout in Kisumu. ', 'We also resolved to meet the county commissioner and security team to get assurance from the national government regarding security during the polls. A week had not passed before rumour had it that a group of 100 youths were being transported from Nairobi to Kisumu to hold a demonstration.They were said to be wearing orange T-shirts printed with the words Ten Million Strong: Raila Must Serve for 10 Years! ', 'The aim of this was to begin instilling suspicion in ODM strongholds that the promise by Raila to serve for one term was hogwash! ', 'During the demonstration, more was to happen with the connivance of a very senior county government official, in collaboration with Jubilee headquarters in Nairobi. ', 'This reminded me of the PNU-inspired post-election violence provocative pamphlets in January 2008, which were printed by the government printers in Nairobi and ferried to the Rift Valley to provoke hatred against ODM. ', 'Fortunately, as the ODM secretary general, I got to know about this in time, informed our security officer, the late Nyaseda, who instructed me to immediately inform David Kimaiyo, the then IG. ', 'He consequently took immediate action and the pamphlet transporters were arrested in Iten before they caused any damage.', 'Likewise, after getting to know about the demonstrators and their evil intentions in Kisumu this week, our team pounced on them as soon as they started to put on the T-shirts behind Cooperative Bank in Kisumus CBD. ', 'They quickly dropped the T-shirts and melted into thin air in the Thursday morning mist. While the T-shirts and posters were seized and burnt by our youth leaders, the county government vehicle which ferried them was seized and handed over to the police. ', 'It is now the duty of the governor to address the county and explain to Kisumu residents why elements within his government are involved in such sinister misadventures. I come back to my theme last week: I fear this election might not be free and fair. ', 'The ruling Jubilee Party is scared that its numbers are not adding up. If they were, President Uhuru Kenyatta would have attended the presidential debate. ', 'He would have been asked the question, Will you accept the results if you lose? Uhuru was afraid to be seen on television and to be recorded in full public view, saying that he would do so  in the presence of Raila. ', 'As far as I am concerned, this was the key issue. Others were secondary. But more than that, the centre does not seem to be holding as D-Day faces the Jubilee party; hence, more panic. ', 'Coupled with the immature manner in which some of Jubilees business potentates are speaking about NASA leadership, wisdom seems to be eluding the ruling party. ', 'This is not the time to sow seeds of hatred. This is the time to intensify confidence-building power breakfasts, where leaders from the two sides of the political divide commune together. ', 'In the final analysis, leaders in the security and intelligence state apparatuses must help Kenyans. They need to stand tall above the political players and protect Kenya as a nation and Kenyans as a people. ', 'I brought this to the attention of security officials in Kisumu at a meeting we held on election matters. ', 'I was particularly concerned about the buying of IDs in Kisumu county. The aim of this sinister operation is to reduce the voter turnout in NASA strongholds. ', 'I thought that the security and intelligence apparatus would go intooverdrive to stop this damage to our electoral process. ', 'Nothing much has been done. ', 'The residents of Kisumu have, therefore, decided to fight this crime the best way they can. ', 'On Thursday, a former MP was almost killed by the people when he was caught with a bunch of IDs in his office. Earlier, we had found a young woman in Seme subcounty with more than 80 IDs in her possession. ', 'Further investigations revealed the involvement of politicians and local civil servants. The identity of these people is with the police intelligence and we hope remedial action is being taken.', 'In the final analysis, the government needs to call an immediate ceasefire on its governing through threats  the Fred Matiangi way  and start governing by confidence-building the George Saitoti way. If there were ever a minister for internal security who knew what his job entailed in a multi- cultural society, it was my late colleague Professor Saitoti. We started off as terrible adversaries during the Moi era but ended up good colleagues in the Narc and Coalition governments. ', 'Even when there was a split in Narc in 2005, and we found ourselves on the opposite sides of the political divide, we continued to compare notes and seek solutions that worked. ', 'I could say the same of my friend Francis Muthaura, who would have been of good service to Jubilee at a time like this. ', 'We need men and women who, notwithstanding their public mien, can promote working compromises at a time like this when the nation stands on the precipice of a possible disaster.', '\n']"

At the writing of the said article, we held our collective national breath for this was the election that followed the infamous 2007 one where blood actually did flow. Its election time again. And all of us are holding our breaths again hoping and praying that the elections in a fortnight will be safe for us, our loved ones and our property. ', 'Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, who developed the classical conditioning theory, is famous for demonstrating how learning can be facilitated by pairing a biological stimulus with a neutral non-biological one. ', 'In his experiment, he rang a bell prior to providing food to dogs and observed them salivating. After a while, dogs who initially salivated (biological stimulus) at the sight and smell of food, salivated only at the ringing of the bell (neutral stimulus) even without the food. Thus, the dogs subconsciously associated the ringing of the bell with provision of food. Pavlov also noted conditioning happened faster the shorter the period between the two stimuli; the ringing of the bell and the provision of food. ', 'What does Pavlov have to do with our elections? From 2007, we learned that the stimulus we have won (biologically casting the vote) and elections are stolen (the neutral stimulus) is followed by flow of blood. ', 'According to Pavlov, if we listen to the narrative that elections are stolen long enough and close enough to the voting day, then blood will flow, even without us casting the vote. This is like salivating without the sight and smell of food.', 'In this election season, we have heard that our team already has 10 million of the 19 million registered votes. The Issack Hassan-led IEBC is gone for we were told that Kenyans had lost confidence in that team. ', 'The Wafula Chebukati-led IEBC is in place, and doubts and aspersions have been cast on its readiness and neutrality to referee this election. ', 'So according to Pavlov, we are conditioned. Whether we cast our votes or not, if Chebukati does not announce our 10 million, then surely votes were stolen and, according to prominent economist David Ndii, blood will flow.', 'To interrogate and apply the Pavlov postulate, we should re-examine who us is.', 'A Somali proverb says: Me and my clan against the world, me and my family against my clan, me and my brother against my family me against my brother.', 'So the proverb insinuates that us is relative and could be my tribeman, clansman, classmate, neighbour or other persons, depending on who the them is. In Kenya, politicians have told us that us is tribesmen.', 'Recently, this was negated by a comment of a Luo woman, who together with her Kikuyu and Luhya neighbours struggle together to get work to wash clothes at Sh50 and later buy water at Sh20 per jerrycan. The Kikuyu woman noted that it is her Luo neighbour to whom she entrusted her children when she was admitted in hospital for 8 days. The Luhya friend visited and brought her a flask full of tea every day she was in hospital. In this case, the us are the neighbours and has nothing to do with tribesmen.', 'I submit that we, as a nation, are trending on a dangerous ground close to the precipice, and must at all costs avoid falling over the edge. All must play their role. ', 'Politicians should refrain from boxing us into tribal cocoons for their personal gain. The IEBC should be faithful to the Constitution, and ensure they operate in a manner that elicits confidence in the electoral process. But even more importantly, all Kenyans of good will must reject the conditioning that these election will result in violence. ', 'We must be clear that the us are people with who we share physical environment such as our neighbours, workmates or classmates and not politicians of our tribe. If this is in doubt, lets remember that we often observe them, the political us group, as they wine and dine together irrespective of tribe. We recently saw this camaraderie in funerals as they sent off members of their us group. ', 'Finally, lets remember that the election will come and go, and we will remain. Actually, whoever we elect should not really make a difference! If you so doubt, check the manifestos of the parties and candidates  they are all the same. Kenya will be a better place for if we vote them in, we will have water, healthcare, education and jobs for all.

All glovers are off as the aspirants take the final stretch, with the undecided votes having less than a week to make up their minds because every Kenyan must vote and should vote come August 8th....', ""The FOMO of not voting is real this time around. No single Kenyan who has registered as a voter wants to be left behind. From Mama Mboga, watchie wa mtaa, wasee wa jobless corner, my bar man en all his colleagues, to the guy who drives the big cars and sits in that corner office, the vibe is the same... Everyone wants to vote, everyone is ready to hire the new team that will lead Kenya for the next five years... I haven't met a single Kenyan who is not vibing with the election... Kenyans are ready and I have faith that by the 11th of August, we will have a tenant in the house on the hill and the elections vibe will be a closed chapter, like the WizKid concert..."", 'Talking off the WizKid concert, BBQLive, which happened at the KICC... The set-up was awesome. WizKid finally showed up in East Africa after missing two gigs in Uganda last year... He not only gave a good show but also managed to jump into studio with Sauti Sol... But like any other big event in Kenya, the show did not miss its share of drama. First things first, it rained not heavy but enough to soak up the revellers. Why the organiser did not go for a full dome knowing very well the Kenyan weather is bipolar beats me... ', ""Concert timing was a tricky day... BBQ Live organisers understand that no Kenyans will come for an all-night event by 2pm... The event time needs to be readjusted to 6pm-6am, with first performance not earlier than 9pm... With event gates opening by 5pm or even 4pm... I know Kenyans never keep time but it's always a good idea for any major concert to market/share the event, line up or programme with the customers the same way they push for ticket sales... This will reduce the pressure on the event hosts and organiser, because most of the customers paying and complimentary will know the exact time to be at the venue for their favourite acts or main act... "", ""Communication is very crucial to avoid embarrassing moments, where we have opening acts performing on stage and the crowd is busy chanting like it's a political rally or the nurses strike demanding for their rights... We have had over five major concerts back-to-back this year, with Kenyans paying big money to attend, which is super fantastic... "", ""But we also need to understand no event will happen without hiccups. Plus this is Kenya, hosting five majors gigs doesn't make us experts overnight, so the critics need to appreciate that we are growing in that sector and for the event organisers, they need to definitely up their game... From the stage management, back stage management to how the VVIP, VIP and the regular crowd is handled... Because Kenyans are willing to pay the big bucks, let's not now turn and give them substandard service... "", ""If a promoter is selling VVIP/VIP, they need to provide the full experience. If not, don't lie to the customer because they have social media and they will come for you after the event... As for the ordinary tickets, the only thing I would ask promoters and event organisers is to tighten the security... And not just that but the security personnel must be very professional... It's common knowledge that will have our petty thieves who will invest that 5K and come steal wallets and phones, but that's not an excuse for the event organisers to ignore or cut short-cuts when it comes to security... "", ""But with that said and done, as #TheRaverend, I'm happy with the entertainment scene because a couple of years back, the issues that were being discussed were worse... Events were marketed, Kenyans paid their hard-earned cash, and the artiste was a no-show... The situation was so bad that advance ticketing was a rumour... We have made major moves in regards to concerts and shows, and I believe it's only going to get better... "", ""Concerts are a big deal all over the world, and the Kenyan culture of drinking in clubs only and not attending shows is dead... So the challenge is with the event organisers to just tie up the loose ends and let's take the concert and entertainment business to the next level... "", ""To the Kenyan artistes who perform alongside the international stars, it's not a competition and you deserve your respect, but always have a technical rider that not only includes what you need for your performance, duration of performance, but also the number of people in your time... Before you attend, do the sound check or even sign up your brand to be used to hype/market the event. You must have your full technical rider requirements met and passes for all the band members sorted to avoid drama with the security on the day of the gig... Just agreeing on the performance fee and assuming everything else will miraculously work out is a very big mistake... "", ""But as #TheRaverend, all I can say is we are all learning from our mistakes and it's the little things we take for granted that will mess up all the gains we have achieved in the events/concerts industry. We all have to work together and respect each other's hustle to grow... So let's all accept our mistakes and shortfalls and focus on the next big event... "", ""Talking of another big event, tonight, we have Jamaican star Busy Signal performing live at the KICC... So all you reggae and dancehall fans, see you at the event. And tomorrow at the Carnivore, Koroga is back, with the headline act being the Coco Master himself. So another major win for +254 as we close the month of Julie in style and welcome Mr Agusta, as we gear up for the biggest concert in the 254 that doesn't require any entrance fee and everyone is VVIP, with the only performer being you the voter and the IEBC as the promoter/event organisers... So enjoy your concert-full weekend as we count down to August 8th, all for the love of Kenya!!!"", '\n']"

TV debates between electoral candidates are invariably little more than a cosmetic exercise. Few candidates ever deliver a knock-out blow to their opponent. There is little evidence that broadcast debates actually alter the minds of voters. In fact, they are much more likely to simply entrench existing views.', 'Having said that, broadcast debates are a useful tool for engaging the electorate. But fortunately in Kenya, we have a public that is already extremely invested in political discussions. As such, perhaps the absence of custom-made television soundbites is no bad thing. It means that public attention can remain focussed on the real debate, the real choice facing our country on August 8.', 'It is a stark choice between two presidential hopefuls. Any rational analysis of the candidates tells a clear story. One has a clear record of spearheading progress for this country. The other has a track record that is not only devoid of achievement, but is intrinsically tied to some of the darkest chapters in our history.', 'President Uhurus last four-and-a-half years at the helm speak volumes. Countless women and their babies have benefitted from free maternal healthcare. Millions of Kenyans have seen their horizons expanded exponentially by being connected to the electricity grid. Meanwhile, newly paved roads and a high-speed railway are making this country more accessible and profitable. In just a short space of time, Uhuru has fixed so much of what has been holding Kenya back.', 'But in contrast, Raila has been in government for decades, with precious little to show for it. Can anyone list the signature achievements or projects from his five years as Prime Minister?', 'And even though Raila served as Roads minister, it appears that Uhuru has been left to pick up the pieces, paving a massive 9,000km since taking office. Meanwhile, the Kibera area, which Raila represented in Parliament for more than 20 years, remains destitute, left to live off Railas empty promises of improvement.', 'Lack of achievement would be bad enough, but Railas long career in public service is also synonymous with some of the most damaging moments in our recent history.', 'Raila has manifestly failed to explain his involvement in the 1982 coup attempt against the Moi government, an act of subversion that cost hundreds of Kenyan lives. And in 2007, his call for mass action was a trigger to the tragic violence that ended so many lives and turned Kenyans against one another. Railas record is also plagued by scandal, as noted by the television debate moderators. The various episodes associated with his name  the Kisumu Molasses Plant, Triton Oil and the Kazi Kwa Vijana programme  have become shorthand for the corruption problem still facing this country.', 'And so it is no wonder that Railas plans, should he enter State House, spell yet more danger for this country. He has pledged that within 100 days in office, he would do away with the direct election of President in favour of an undefined hybrid parliamentary system. This is nothing less than the destruction of the social contract between the people and the President and as such, our very democracy itself.', 'Meanwhile, as he reiterated on stage, Raila also insists that he would pull Kenyan troops out of Somalia. This reckless scheme would endanger Kenyans, bringing al Shabaab closer to their homes. It would also seriously damage our foreign relations with regional and international allies committed to tackling terror.', 'All these contrast sharply with Uhurus determined plan for progress, if he is reelected. It includes a nationwide programme of youth internships, which already has the backing of big business. And it also promises to bring free secondary education for all, and an expansion of maternity healthcare, initiatives that have already been valued. In short, Uhuru is offering a realistic yet ambitious blueprint for all Kenyans to progress.', 'If anything, the circus surrounding television debates tends only to muddy the clear waters. They allow slick rhetoric and attention-grabbing phrases to blur what is a very clear choice for the electorate. Even without the aid of a staged televised event, anyone who cares to give even a cursory glance at the respective records and plans of the two presidential candidates will see a clear choice between two contrasting future paths for our country. It is either Uhuru the fixer, or Raila the destroyer.', '\n']"

(Article) 50 (2) (of Kenyas constitution) relates to the rights of an accused person. Neither the first respondent (Paul Gicheru) nor the second respondent (Philip Bett) is an accused person, Nderitu said.', 'A little later, Nderitu elaborated his point.', 'As they (Gicheru and Bett) are here in court they are here as suspects, not as accused persons, he told the court.', 'This is not a trial. If it was a trial then there would be witnesses that would be called in the normal way to come and give evidence, Nderitu said, referring to the fact that the court was only hearing submissions from lawyers.', 'Nderitu further argued that giving evidence to a wanted individual before they are arrested would give them an opportunity to flee.', 'It would be total anarchy, he said.', 'Nderitu made the submissions on Wednesday as an interested party in his capacity as the lawyer who represented victims in the now terminated trial of Deputy President William Samoei Ruto and former journalist Joshua arap Sang.', 'Judge Luka Kimaru has to review two applications. One is the application the Director of Public Prosecutions has made to execute the ICC arrest warrant for Gicheru and Bett. Lawyers for Gicheru and Bett have filed their own applications asking the court to quash the ICC arrest warrant.', 'Gicheru and Bett are wanted by the ICC on allegations they bribed or attempted to bribe six prosecution witnesses, offering between 500,000 shillings (about US $4,800 at current exchange rates) and five million shillings (about US $48,000) to each to withdraw as witnesses. These bribery allegations are offenses under Article 70 of the ICCs founding law, the Rome Statute.', 'The ICC issued, under seal, the arrest warrant against them on March 10, 2015.

', 'Some of the pseudonyms of the witnesses given in the arrest warrant for Gicheru and Bett correspond with those witnesses who testified during the trial of Ruto and Sang, which was terminated in April 2016.', 'Nderitu then argued that the lawyers for Gicheru and Bett needed to show that these provisions did not provide their clients with safeguards.', 'It is my submission that that has not been shown at all, Nderitu said.', 'The International Crimes Act is based on the Rome Statute and was legislated after Kenya became a member of the ICC.', 'PROVISIONS AGAINST DISCRIMINATION', 'It is my submission that the respondents have not demonstrated how these provisions have been violated in relation to them, Nderitu said.', 'One issue that Judge Kimaru and Nderitu spent some time discussing was the role of the High Court of Kenya when it is presented with a request for arrest and surrender from the ICC.', 'Nderitu submitted that the High Court had the power to determine whether individuals wanted by the ICC should be surrendered to that court. However, the High Court cannot determine whether there was a credible basis for an ICC arrest warrant.', 'So, the warrant is a fait accompli? asked Judge Kimaru.', 'The warrant is fait accompli, replied Nderitu. But the court can inquire into the surrender.', 'Judge Kimaru then asked Nderitu to explain how the High Court of Kenya related with the ICC. The judge asked whether the ICC was a court of concurrent jurisdiction or whether it had complementary jurisdiction or whether it was superior to the High Court of Kenya. Nderitu said the ICC was a court of concurrent jurisdiction but it has had a complementary jurisdiction.', 'Nderitu also told the court that the March 10, 2015 decision of the Single Judge of the ICCs Pre-Trial Chamber II to issue an arrest warrant for Gicheru and Bett should be presumed to have been made in good faith.', 'Nderitu elaborated that when the Single Judge made the decision that it was appropriate for the ICC to exercise its jurisdiction in the case of Gicheru and Bett, then it is to be presumed that all due diligence in the process of determining the appropriateness was under taken.', 'Before Nderitu made his submissions on Wednesday, Judge Kimaru allowed Kibe Mungai, a lawyer representing Gicheru to present further arguments. Mungai had previously made submissions in this case more than two weeks ago.', 'Mungai told the court that in early 2015 his client was summoned to the Kilimani police station in Nairobi and asked to record a statement in relation to alleged interference with ICC witnesses. Mungai said that since then the police have not communicated with Gicheru.', 'Therefore, we presume the investigation did not disclose any wrongdoing on the part of Gicheru, said Mungai.', 'He also told the court that the Attorney General (AG) should not have been allowed to make submissions as an amicus curiae, or friend of the court.', 'Mungai said the Attorney General had authorised the execution of the ICC request, as detailed in a May 14, 2015 letter of then Cabinet Secretary for Internal Security Joseph Nkaissery to the Director of Public Prosecutions.', 'As the AG had played a vital role of initiating the proceedings before you, his position as amicus in this matter is heavily compromised because it was on his advice that these proceedings commenced, Mungai said.', 'Mungai also submitted that there is evidence of very serious wrongdoing on the part of officials of the ICC, that needed to be addressed and related to the arrest warrant for his client. Mungai did not give any details of the alleged wrongdoing but he said the allegations were in an affidavit submitted to the High Court.', 'It is our submission that there is good evidence of oppression and prejudice, Mungai said.', 'Once Mungai and Nderitu completed their submissions, Judge Kimaru said the hearing would continue onThursday.', '\n']"

These bribery allegations are offenses under Article 70 of the Rome Statute.', ' ', 'The ICC issued, under seal, the arrest warrant against them on March 10, 2015.

Ipsos had Uhuru ahead at 47 per cent to Railas 43 per cent and Infotrak announced the former Prime Minister at 47 per cent to Uhurus 43 per cent.', 'This divergence of results underpinned by the concurrence that the President and his challenger are actually in a dead heat struck a number of analysts as questionable. ', 'Macharia Gaitho, writing in the Daily Nation on Tuesday under the headline Why opinion poll results are questionable, commented, While the Zogby survey could be dismissed because it was paid for and publicised by the NASA campaign, the Infotrak one should attract attention as the first poll in the run-upto [the election] to place Mr Odinga ahead of President Kenyatta.', 'Gaitho patently disbelieves Infotrak chief executive officers Angela Ambithos explanation of Railas dramatic surge of four percentage points to overtake Uhuru. Ambitho argued, More people have decided. NASA had more undecided in their strongholds than Jubilee did.', 'THE COUNTIES, NOT THE DEFUNCT PROVINCES, ARE WHAT COUNTS NOW', 'There is an inescapable factor that has been brought to the fore by the divergence between Ipsos and Infotrak: Any opinion polling of Kenyans on the question of the race for State House needs to be done according to the counties, not the now-defunct provincial boundaries. And it must poll individuals indigenous to particular counties, not, for instance, a Kikuyu who resides in Bungoma or a Bukusu who resides in Nyeri. ', 'Under devolution, pollsters need to go to the extent of asking respondents where they come from: Context is everything. There is a reason that the Kuria vote differently from the Luo despite the fact that they are both from Nyanza.', 'Having arrived at the conclusion that the August 8 presidential context is a two-horse race that is currently in a neck-by-neck dead heat, the pollsters will need to focus their attentions on the decisive factor of turnout, i.e. how the winner will pull ahead of the loser and establish a lead, from narrow to commanding. ', 'An interesting factor of what happens next is, for instance, that President Uhuru would win by 52% if JP maintains its 2013 performance, an even wider margin than four-and-a-half years ago.', 'A careful look at the Infotrak poll shows the pollster visited the following 13 NASA-leaning counties  Kilifi, Kwale, Mombasa, Taita Taveta, Kitui, Machakos, Makueni, Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Homa Bay, Kisii and Kisumu. Infotrack visited the following nine Jubilee leaning counties  Embu, Meru, Kiambu, Nyeri, Baringo, Bomet, Nakuru, Uasin Gishu and Muranga.', 'Infotrak left out the following NASA-compliant counties  Siaya, Migori, Nyamira, Vihiga. And they left out the following Jubilee-compliant counties  West Pokot, Nandi, Laikipia, Kericho, Elgeyo Marakwet, Nyandarua, Kirinyagaand Tharaka-Nithi.', 'The swing states in this case are Samburu, Isiolo and Tana River, Lamu.', 'What does this mean? It means that Infotrak over-sampled NASA by four counties, rendering their poll biased.', 'STUDY THE SWING VOTES, THE STRONGHOLDS ARENT GOING ANYWHERE', 'The major pollsters would do well to study the so-called swing vote blocs more than the strongholds of either side. The strongholds arent going anywhere, whoever the final winner. But the swing vote blocs are in ferment and contain the bulk of the undecided.', 'The Jubilee strongholds are Baringo, Bomet, Elgeyo Marakwet, Embu, Kericho, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Laikipia, Meru, Muranga, Nakuru, Nandi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Tharaka-Nithi, Uasin Gishu and West Pokot. Based on the IEBCs latest register, there are 7.41 million voters in these counties.', 'The NASA strongholds are Bungoma, Busia, Kakamega, Kilifi, Kisumu, Kitui, Kwale, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Migori, Mombasa, Siaya, Taita Taveta, Tana River and Vihiga counties. Based on the IEBCs latest updated figures, these counties have 7.02 million registered voters.', 'The following are the battleground counties: Nairobi, Kajiado, Narok, Kisii, Nyamira, Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, Marsabit, Isiolo, Turkana, Samburu and Trans Nzoia. According to the IEBC, they have 5.1 million registered voters.', 'SHIFTS AND UNDERLYING TENSIONS', 'The local dynamics in every county have dramatically changed over the past four-and-a-half years. The main reasons for these shifts are the changing demographics of the voting population, who are younger, more youthful, more open-minded and more development-conscious than ever before.', 'Accurate mapping is now done by the counties, not by the old provinces. The latter no longer exist in the era of devolution and the Constitution of Kenya 2010. The new regions are the counties. To reiterate, the key thing to grasp and proceed from is that the electoral map has changed dramatically since the 11th General Election of March 2013. The new regions are the counties.', 'Trends since 2013 show that Jubilee and NASA have an equal number of stronghold counties  17 each. The remaining 13 counties are now considered battleground counties. These counties have received the most attention from both the Jubilee and NASA strategists and campaigners.', 'As at March 2017, the JP strongholds were Baringo, Bomet, Elgeyo/Marakwet, Embu, Kericho, Kiambu, Kirinyaga, Laikipia, Meru, Muranga, Nakuru, Nandi, Nyandarua, Nyeri, Tharaka-Nithi, Uasin Gishu and West Pokot counties.', 'In March, the NASA strongholds were Bungoma, Busia, Homa Bay, Kakamega, Kilifi, Kisumu, Kitui, Kwale, Lamu, Machakos, Makueni, Migori, Mombasa, Siaya, Taita Taveta, Tana River and Vihiga counties.', 'COUNTY DYNAMICS HAVE CHANGED', 'The local dynamics within each of the 47 counties have changed over the last four-and-a-half years. The demographics of the voting population have changed, becoming more youthful, more open-minded and more development-conscious.', 'Delivery of development projects has cut across all the counties in Kenya. This has helped the Kenyan electorate to gradually becoming more issue-focused. In addition, both Jubilee and NASA have been making inroads into each others perceived traditional strongholds. These forays have also changed the electoral map, resulting in a situation where the 2013 returns cannot be wholly relied upon.', 'These changing dynamics have resulted in the mapping of battleground or swing counties.', 'From where JP is standing, Kisii is on the move; the Somali communities have moved; Lamu, Tana River and Taita Taveta are already considerably with JP.', 'THE BATTLEGROUND COUNTIES', 'A key indicator of this is the enormous focus both campaigns have placed on key counties. An analysis of their campaign visits reveals that both campaign teams have focused primarily on 13 counties.', 'This analysis reveals that there are 13 battleground counties. Both Jubilee and NASA are hoping to flip these counties in their favour and claim them as their own. Based on the observable trends on the ground, Jubilee has no counties at risk; NASA has 3 counties at considerable risk of flipping. After the second and final Mass Voter Registration (MVR II), a quick comparison of the respective strongholds shows that Jubilee is starting off with more than 400,000 votes ahead of NASA. These voter registration statistics reveal that Jubilee run a more effective voter mobilisation exercise than NASA. These numbers also suggest that there are higher levels of apathy in NASA strongholds than in Jubilee strongholds.', 'Since MVR II, Uhuru and Ruto have campaigned aggressively  running high octane, energetic serial campaign tours. The two have also delivered a very compelling, development-oriented message, backed by an impressive, credible track record.', 'NASAs campaign messaging has tended to fall back on old prescriptions. It relies heavily on political rhetoric, which is divisive and unappealing  particularly to the large majority of youth who remain undecided.', 'NASAs anti-election message is also increasingly being rejected on the ground, whereas Jubilees stand  that of protecting the election date  is viewed a lot more favourably by a large cross section of the public.', 'The credible, objective pollsters who will begin to show Uhuru maintain and even pull away from Raila, or vice versa, will be in a position to call the August 8 election.', '\n']"

This in a nutshell, is the Ruto paradox.\nHow is it that someone evokes so much love/hate emotions every time he starts\nto speak? On July 12, a crowd in Kisumu recently shouted to the President Uhuru\nKenyattas face, Hatutaki Ruto! yet the same crowd (most likely) had been on\nhand to shout DP Rutos praise, when he was an ODM Pentagon member in 2007. This\nphenomenon is of course not new to Ruto.

Conversely, if they\nlose, they will blame it on man  Ruto. Its that plain and simple. It only\ndepends on how the Deputy President will play with the mind of the restive\nmajority. There are those who are going to vote, not against Uhuru but against Ruto.\nThere are also those who are also going to vote, not for Uhuru but for his\ndeputy. In fact, Uhuru seems to have somehow insulated himself against the\npolitics of Kenyas restless voter. The Deputy President isnt there yet. He is\nwrestling with him.', ' ', 'YESTERDAYS\nLOVERS AND TODAYS LOATHERS', ' ', 'Nearly every\nKenyan politician or voter has at one time exhibited the two emotions towards\nRuto intense love and intense hatred.

If the nominations went badly  the\nDeputy President became the convenient scapegoat, the ultimate fall guy. They accused\nhim of everything from raising and financing opponents to bringing up\nprojects and imposing them on the people.

Instead of reaching out to those he has wronged, he would\nrather have them go over to the other side and remain there, bringing down the\nbridge and waiting to see what they will do. There are many people opposing him\nnow who have been his bosom friends, including Governor Isaac Rutto, Senator Gideon\nMoi, Cyrus Jirongo, Peter Kenneth, Senator Boni Khalwale, Musalia Mudavadi,\nKalonzo Musyoka, Senator Moses Wetangula, Charity Ngilu and even NASA leader\nRaila Odinga. The list is long, very long in fact. How does he convert so many\nfriends into such powerful enemies? Unless of course he did not consider them his\nfriends in the first place.

I jumped at the offer. But when\nwe arrived at the gate, we were turned back when they discovered we had no\ntickets. We were frisked by the hawk-eyed security and our car checked by sniffer\ndogs in what turned out to be a well-organised security programme. We did not\nknow we needed tickets. So we quickly made for a nearby restaurant to watch the\ndebate on TV. We, however, sat waiting for hours in vain. My friend, however,\nhappened to have the DP Rutos number, sent him a passionate plea to show up\nfor the debate, but he ignored the text just the same. He instead treated us to\nan hour and a half of a quasi-diatribe by someone we were all seeing for the\nfirst time. Between us we agreed that we probably didnt quite understand this UhuRuto\nduo, described by Mutahi Ngunyi as the Ferrari candidacy as opposed to NASAs\nmatatu candidacy (all inclusive). ', ' ', 'FOR WHOM THE\nBELL TOLLS', ' ', 'Another paradox\nis the DPs stand on the TJRC Report. Yes, he is mentioned in the report, but\nlargely on minor issues some of which he has already dealt with. His role in\nthe 2007-08 PEV is mentioned and by the time the report was released, he was\nalready appearing before the ICC. His discussion of the Wagalla Massacre on the\nfloor of the House on October 18, 2000 came under scrutiny but not much else\nsave for a recommendation the he be prosecuted together with others on matters\nrelating to land, and for that he has already had his day in court. He should,\ntherefore, be the last man to have sleepless nights over the report any more\nthan President Uhuru or even Raila should. But there are millions of Kenyans\nwho needlessly suffered the grind of the Kanu machine and also in subsequent\nregimes. DP Ruto should personally know the pain of being falsely accused\nbefore an international court, which is why his stand is just another paradox.\nHow should he let the tears of millions flow in vain? Perhaps that stand on the\nTJRC Report should bring him to the words of Donne in his famous line, And,\ntherefore, never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.', '\n']"

She studied journalism at the Kenya Institute of Mass Communication and upon graduation, she started a private media school.', '\n', 'That was not to last, however, because it was a capital-intensive undertaking,as she needed to buy expensive equipment and she did not have the people to fund the project.', '\n', 'The banks did not have much faith in the project and refused to fund it.', '\n', 'After this stint failed, Lindy got an opportunity to travel to the Netherlands to work, and while there, she nurtured her public speaking skills and started speaking at conferences.', '\n', 'In the process, she met her husband and that is how she ended up moving to Sweden.', '\n', 'When Lindy moved to Sweden, she noticed something that seemed to ring true across most Scandinavian countries: women make a significant percentage of the people holding senior positions in government and boards.', '\n', 'Women in Parliament', '\n', 'In Sweden, women make up 45 per cent of the people in Parliament.', '\n', 'Lindy asked herself why women back in Kenya were not doing the same.', '\n', 'Before Parliament was adjourned, there were 86 women in Parliament: 16 elected MPs, 47 woman representatives, five nominated MPs and 18 nominated senators. Womens representation stood at 21 per cent.', '\n', 'In the corporate sector, women in Sweden make up 13 per cent of the leaders.

There is no reason women in Kenya cannot do the same, she says.', '\n', 'The project provides young women with vocational training in mechanics.', '\n', 'Lindys vocational training centre, the Womens Academy, has trained women in beauty, mechanics, catering, event planning and ICT.', '\n', 'Lindy says it has not been easy to start and sustain some projects, but her mantra in life is never give up in trying to make a positive change.', '\n', 'She says she has faced some biases in Sweden, because some people think Africans are lazy.', '\n', 'I dont let these biases slow me down.

This man went ahead to express his fear that from his experience, with many families with officers who served Hitler as high ranking officers, if the German nation were to face collapse of the economy and be afflicted by poverty and hardships, they would quite easily revert to their dark past. The fear of Nazism repeating itself compelled this brave man to expose the evil his father executed, while serving Nazism, and his refusal to forgive him.

People must begin to condemn those who killed Dedan Kimathi and Mau Mau. People must begin to condemn architects of one-party dictatorship. People must begin to condemn perpetrators of crimes against humanity. Equally, people must praise national heroes and their role in attaining our Independence, the Second Liberation and justice. As Milan Kundera said, The struggle of people against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting.', 'Generations cause and solve their problems for which they must bear responsibility. Europeans created the mess of colonialism and most of our problems today. After Independence, founding fathers gave us one-party dictatorship and its tyranny. When you see problems today, our leaders must bear responsibility and blame, not false credit and praise.', 'We are hypocrites when we blame God or even Satan for our problems. Just as leaders caused pain to millions when creating their problems, for those problems, they must also bear shame and blame even in the grave.', '\n']"

However, Kenyans should appreciate that these issues are a product of progressive provisions of rights as enshrined in the 2010 Constitution. ', 'It provides individuals and organisations with unfettered rights to question any public process, be it administrative, procurement or handling of governance-related issues.', 'Any form of right or privilege is bound to pose challenges but the nation must take these challenges in stride, with a view of strengthening national institutions.', 'It is, therefore, important that the IEBC endeavours to project a neutral and progressive attitude, particularly in regards to the voters register, which is an integral component in ensuring a free and fair election. It is only by doing things in the right way, and following the law that the electoral commission, and any other institution for that matter, can avoid unnecessary legal and political roadblocks since our society has become fairly liberal and litigious.', 'It would be important that the IEBC publishes and publicises the full list of all the eligible voters in good time as required by the law to eliminate suspicion, which could lead to political stalemates.', 'By making the voters register open and accessible to the public, any interested party would have an opportunity to interrogate and ventilate their concerns.', 'In essence, this approach will have mitigated major concerns that may undermine the credibility of the outcome. It almost goes without saying that the voters register is an important public document that should be accessible to all stakeholders. It will serve no useful purpose for anyone to treat it as a secret or classified document. Its contents should be released to all stakeholders for their sufficient verification and interrogation prior to the election.', 'The Judiciary has done extremely well in diffusing some of the emerging political disputes between political players. ', 'Some of the court judgements and rulings may not be popular with some of the players or the affected parties but it is the cardinal duty of the Judiciary to determine disputes. ', 'Their business is not to please parties but to look at facts and evidence laid before it and in line with the laws of the land. The Judiciary has in its handling of electoral disputes demonstrated its ability to work independently and within deadlines.', 'Political players should be encouraged to ventilate their future disputes within the legally established institutions rather than whipping public emotions.', 'The institutions mandated to ensure that national cohesion and security should ensure they objectively and fairly execute their work to create confidence in the electoral process. ', 'They should remain steadfast in guaranteeing protection of life, property and liberty of all Kenyans without being biased towards any side of political divide. The church and religious leaders should also rise up to the occasion by urging their faithful to embrace objective electioneering attitude and for them to elect leaders on basis of their credibility and capacity to lead.', 'Kenyans too, particularly the youth, should not be used to disrupt the peace. The recent ugly violent incidents witnessed in Kisumu, Kabarnet, Thika and Muranga where leading presidential candidates were heckled or stoned are a disgrace in a democracy and have no place in civilised communities.', 'Civil Society and lobby groups should also remain focussed in articulating observance of respect of fundamental rights and good governance by state agencies. The same is expected of independent commissions such as the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights Commission.', 'Finally, it is the onus of all individuals, organisations and institutions in Kenya to ensure that this election is free, fair and peaceful, since the country must be there for posterity.', '\n']"

Pledges that were meant to improve this country and get it to Rostows Takeoff Stage of Economic Growth?  The answer is no. ', 'If it had, there would be no shortage of unga; there wouldnt be such high levels of unemployment hitting almost 65 per cent and there would have been thriving industries and an environment that would attract investments to deal with a burgeoning wage bill that is hitting almost a trillion.', 'Jubilee made some very concise promises: That they would make Kenya a double-digit economy; that they would build five international stadia, create five million jobs, build 9,500km of tarmacked roads and give laptops to all standard one pupils (the most heart-wrenching promise because it was to our children). The expected narrative from Jubilee would have been to state that on each of the promises the progress is this far, something we have not heard being talked about. Instead, more promises upon broken pledges are being made. If the earlier promises were not met, what guarantee is there that the new ones will be met since its the same leaders seeking a second term?', 'The argument that the NASA principals have been in ministerial positions behooves the fact that governments are controlled and managed fully by the President. During the coalition government, the level of corruption was controlled and many of the progressive developmental plans were made then. That was a taste of what the NASA government will bring to Kenyans. The NASA principals are committed to reaching every corner of this nation, engaging every citizen to spread the message of change and securing the future of our nation. The possibility of the reality to make Kenya great again!', 'That includes creating jobs and employment opportunities and growing the economy, which in turn will lower the cost of living for Kenyans. Job creation will be achieved by promoting empowerment in various sectors; promoting investors interest in our country, promoting private companies, encouraging local production, helping counties in forming various economic blocs, which in turn will lower the cost of basic commodities', 'The NASA government will control basic commodity prices, rent and ensure availability of power and production in all energy sectors. NASA will lower PAYE and pay citizens according to their efforts, by rewarding them genuinely. Tax will be lowered and tax collection improved in terms of collection and usage. All workers, be they medics, teachers, the police, civil servants Jua Kali artisans and those in the private sector will be entitled to good pay. Within the first 90 days of taking office, NASA will offer free secondary education, lower university fees and increase the Helb allocation.', 'In healthcare, NASA will ensure access to medical care by building and equipping hospitals and ensuring timely payments to doctors and nurses. We will work with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union to build modern hospitals in each county. We should be able to treat diseases such as cancer locally. The Universal Health Service Scheme Fund will ensure adequate heath facilities for all Kenyans. A medical research fund will receive an annual two per cent of the heath budget.', 'NASA will build houses for the police and other members of the security services, schools, provide furniture, books and pay teachers well. We will invest in youth training and acquisition of technical skills such as welding, carpentry, masonry, etc. Living in our own nation should not be exogenous. Through the Constitution, NASA will control land rates, lower rents and mortgage rates for Kenyans to concentrate on developing the economy. We will also invest in agriculture to improve food production and pay higher prices for farm produce so that farmers can make profits. To enhance productivity and convenient access to the markets, NASA will upgrade and tarmack feeder roads so that farmers can transport their produce on time and easily. We will boost farming by ensuring our farmers receive support, get good rates for their produce and continued flow of production as its done in Egypt. As a result, we will ensure food security and have surplus to export. Among the exports we target are miraa, tea, coffee, flowers and cereals.', 'Under devolution, NASA will ensure there is equal distribution of national resources and development through channeling 45 per cent of the national government resources to the counties. NASA wants to see Nakuru as our New Jersey, Kisumu our New York, Meru as California, Machakos as Florida, Muranga as Hawaii, Nyeri as Texas, Busia as Pennsylvania, Kakamega as Alaska, Migori as Alabama, Homa Bay as Michigan, Kisii as Ohio, Bomet as Georgia, Eldoret as Virginia and that is why we fought for devolved government. Kenyans must therefore elect competent governors.', 'NASA will set up a cushion fund that will be used to provide emergency assistance to the vulnerable. Payment of pensions for the old and equal distribution to our elders will be mandatory.', 'We will form a united and inclusive government, in which all Kenyans will participate in its progress. Kenya will belong to all and for all. We will also solve historical injustices with peace and reach consensus and families that have faced problems with their land and IDPs will be compensated and resettled. The NASA government also looks forward to ending the perennial cattle rustling.', 'NASA will revive the slum upgrade project that President Mwai Kibaki, Raila and Kalonzo Musyoka begun in the Grand Coalition government. In infrastructure, NASA will construct a dual road from Mombasa through to Malaba passing through Nairobi, Nakuru, Kericho Junction to Kisumu, Busia, Malaba to Eldoret. We will ensure an electric train is procured, which will be an improvement to the current diesel SGR train, from Mombasa-Nairobi-Naivasha-Eldoret-Kisumu-Kakamega- all the way to Malaba, connecting Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Ethiopia to ease trade.', 'In order to achieve all these aspirations, NASA will ensure peace and security. To do this, we will devolve security to ensure each county is well-equipped in protecting residents. ', 'Our youths are the future of our nation, we will empower them to be productive, as will be the case with women. Persons living with disabilities will not be left behind, and we will ensure they are able to meaningfully contribute to the economy. NASA asks you to join us in spreading its gospel by reaching out to as many people as you can. Your network is much wider, if we put all our hands together, NASA will bring the change that this country desperately needs. You are the change Kenya desires, as Raila has said.', '\n']"

The aim is to make the most of available tradeable resources and advantages.Within this space, innovation is used to buy and integrate new technology to increase output and quality. For instance, to get the most out of the tea sector based on the advantage that the country has the highest market share of tea globally.There is also the opportunity presented by rising labour costs in China and factories are looking to relocate to countries with lower labour costs.', '\n', 'Second, efficient and reliable institutions can reduce bottlenecks that discourage investment. Well-known constraints such as red tape, infrastructure, legal systems, work force issues, financial capital etc. increase the cost of production. Industrial parks and economic zones are one way of creating a concentration of economic activity and an anchor for more development. ', '\n', 'Third, an efficient market is important to signal the relative prices of production factors. The prices of scarce resources rise while those of goods in plentiful supply fall. This helps to tell investors where investment opportunities are. For instance recently, because of the growth of the construction sector, prices of cement increased because demand was higher than supply. Some entrepreneurs saw the opportunity and invested in a new cement factory. ', '\n', 'Fourth, countries need to drive capital towards sectors that have the highest potential. Tax incentives, budgetary policies and industry strategies need to work together and focus on these sectors. The aim is to drive private investment towards them. Where returns are slow and long-term in nature, development finance becomes necessary. Financial reforms may be necessary to meet the financing needs.', '\n', 'Finally, government needs to monitor shifts in factor advantages and align strategy. The comparative advantage of factors is constantly shifting. The government then focuses its efforts on building infrastructure and institutions that support industries operating within the new factor advantages. This will enable those industries to thrive and maximise on economic growth. The monitoring can also inform government investment plans. When the economy is in decline, for instance, the government may choose to invest in infrastructure to take advantage of the low cost of capital and create employment. This will also stimulate the economy.', '\n', 'These lessons provide a dynamic base to drive industry growth and economic development. To support these lessons is the need to mobilise domestic resources. This may be by improving tax collection, broadening the tax base, reducing capital flight and increasing local financial resource mobilization.', '\n', '\n']"

To say that they all tell lies is yet another lie. One can disagree with a manifesto, but that does not mean that it is a lie or a carbon copy of another manifesto. Once it is a carbon copy then it ceases to be a manifesto; It becomes a plaything of a person or a group of people who are not serious about putting forth their ideas and aspirations to an audience or audiences whose approval or support is sought.', 'The current discussions on the Jubilee and NASA manifestos seem to be dominated by a lot of passion between approvers and disapprovers, or between supporters and virulent critics. This is not necessarily a bad thing: It makes readers take interest in the content of the two documents. The debate further draws attention to the fact that something is at stake in these two manifestos. It is this thing which is at stake that interests me immensely, and why it should be fought over or sought via the manifesto and the arguments it raises.', 'The thing at stake is state power. Jubilee currently occupies state power. This means Jubilee rules Kenya. The executive power of government lies in the hands of the Jubilee leaders, to be specific Uhuru Kenyatta as President and William Ruto as Deputy President. But executive power is not exercised in a vacuum: It is exercised to serve and reproduce a system of social and economic relations, in which the interests of many people are served. Businessmen are key players: They do a lot of business with the state. Imagine all that complicated equipment the military buys from time to time. The businessmen who sell this equipment must make a lot of money, hence they are always interested in who controls state power. They will be keen to ensure a manifesto that seeks support from voters will guarantee them the election of a party or a coalition that will give them business.', 'A coalition or a political party may decide that while it recognises businessmen as key players in society, the focus of the government it intends to serve is not really businessmen but ordinary folk  farmers, carpenters, watchmen, students, workers and so on. In any case, these are the majority when it comes to looking for votes. The manifesto will , therefore, seek to appeal for support from these sections of society, even though the key interests the wielders of state power will serve after elections may be quite different. I say key interests and not all interests. There is definitely no manifesto on earth that can serve the interests of everybody; but key interests must always be there. How, then, do we identify these key interests?', 'First, the people who are at the forefront of any movement or political party that seeks to get state power do not drop like manna from heaven; they live with us right here on earth.', 'Second, they do not get into politics because they are missionaries. They get into politics because they want to advance certain interests  including theirs  by occupying state power.', 'Third, even when we have identified their interests, they are clever enough to know that winning an election is a game of numbers. And since they need the majority to win the election, they must somehow gather this majority from somewhere. It is the manner of gathering majorities and the way majorities are glued together after elections that distinguishes the objectives and aims of one party from another.', 'When people ask whether our parties differ or are similar in ideologies or not, quite often they miss the point by rushing and concluding that our parties are the same ideologically because they all appeal to ethnic or tribal sentiments to gather majorities. They forget to ask a further question which could then bring out the ideological differences among our parties. And this question is: How do they seek to keep these majorities together once in state power or out of it?', 'I have noticed two distinct types of political coalitions in our country: Jubilee and Cord/NASA. That, perhaps, is not a very earthshaking discovery. But I have discovered something further. These two coalitions have two very different ways of keeping the majorities they have gathered to win state power after the election.', 'Jubilee has tended to adopt an adhesive tape approach of keeping its majority together very much like totalitarian political parties do while Cord/NASA has sought a mobilisation strategy, where the coalition is always opening doors to a broader majority with an expansive leadership at the top. Unfortunately, in Kenyas short history, the name Kenyatta has been associated with the rise of the imperial presidency, while the name Odinga has been associated with the challenge to this type of regime, preferring state power based on popular mobilisation and devolution of political power. A state controlled by a powerful presidential elite is less likely to serve broad popular interests, however benevolent, than a state based on broad popular participation and mass mobilization. The former is more likely to nurture a capitalist developmental state with democracy for the few, while the latter is more likely to nurture a national democratic and developmental state with popular democracy.', 'Please do not ask me to elaborate. I may end up writing a whole book on this which may not be allowed within the space I am provided here. But one thing I want to tell the reader for free is that devolution is much safer where you deliberately set out to build a national democratic and developmental state than where you emphasise big infrastructural projects as the engines of growth without bothering much about the costs. These costs inform the sacrifices the nation has to make regarding prioritising other human development initiatives, which promote social democratic cohesion among our people. Where people who wield state power are themselves tenderpreneurs, big infrastructural projects, costing an arm and a leg, and put up at great costs to the economy through expensive foreign commercial debts, will definitely subvert any possibility for the emergence of a national developmental and democratic state.', 'Why is this type of state desirable in our context? First, it requires that the majority on which the legitimacy of wielding state power is derived be truly national  representative of the face of the nation. A government formed as a result of putting together such a nationally based majority cannot seek to deliberately lose its legitimacy by becoming parochial or sectarian.

The voting patterns in the 2013 presidential election results have no indication that President Uhuru Kenyattas victory could be attributed to the laptop promise. Personally, I believe the project was not a top priority in a country where the majority of secondary schools have no science laboratories.', 'Nevertheless, whenever tender fights over procurement of the laptops erupted, the media would fill up with stories about how Jubilee was failing to deliver on its key campaign promise. I am unaware of any significant public demand for laptops.', 'The way I see it is that in lobbying for inclusion of specific projects in manifestos the tenderpreneurs-cum-campaign financiers are effectively buying political insurance for their financial contributions in three key respects.', 'First, these projects have been accorded special priority status and are supposed to be implemented within tight schedules to guarantee that before the principals in a new administration learn their way in the dark world of project finance or groom their own brokers, the campaign financiers would have been paid their commissions.', 'Secondly, through the manifesto the prerogative and autonomy of the incoming Cabinet and Parliament to determine national economic agenda and allocation of resources are curtailed or compromised in advance.', 'Thirdly, the inclusion of these projects in the manifesto enables the tenderpreneurs to subsequently disguise their private schemes as the national agenda on the basis of which the government was voted into power.', 'Logically, from the standpoint of tenderpreneurs, regime change every five years is the best-case scenario because an opposition coalition is more vulnerable to their demands than the incumbent, which is likely to curry the favour of established businesses with vested interest in policy continuity.', 'Viewed this way, we should probably thank Dr David Ndii and his reformist associates in NASA for their objections to the growing influence of tenderpreneurs in their coalition.', 'From a public interest standpoint, there are three reasons why Kenyans should be sceptical about manifestos and their place in national economic planning and management.', 'First, Kenya is a poor country enjoined under Article 201 of its Constitution to use public money in a prudent and responsible way whilst ensuring openness and accountability, including public participation. Given that none of the coalition and political parties have engaged their supporters in making their manifestos, it is obvious that the preferences of party owners and principals should not be viewed as legally binding after the election.', 'In my view, after winning power the winning coalition should review its manifesto to align it with the public interest and priorities, otherwise a manifesto can easily become an instrument of corruption.', 'Secondly, Articles 95 and 96 of the Constitution vest in the National Assembly and Senate the mandate to determine, allocate and appropriate national revenue to national government, the counties and national state organs. This collective responsibility should never be subordinated to manifestos written in boardrooms and exclusive hotels.', 'Finally, the majority of the special projects in the political manifestos will have to be financed through foreign borrowing. Under Article 214 of the Constitution public debt is a charge on the Consolidated Fund. There is obvious danger that manifestobacked projects will deprive the country of resources to finance projects that may be more useful and justified.', 'Likewise such projects can easily secure sovereign immunity from prosecution for their promoters in case of any corruption because government officials would be compromised in advance to allow the tenderpreneurs to recover their political investment. Hence, there will be no political will to fight corruption relating to procurement and financing of such projects.', 'To conclude, the apparent discovery by the corruption cartels of the value of manifestos presents the spectre of fragile countries being bankrupted by corruption or auctioning their sovereignty for 30 pieces of silver.', '\n']"

', 'The focus within the Swiss\nfinancial sector was on becoming a clean financial sector rather than a place\nnotorious as a haven for illegally obtained funds; and this involved a policy\nshift towards transparency.', 'As explained by Ambassador Ralf\nHeckner, from that point onwards, Switzerland would no longer be a safe haven\nfor the corrupt. ', ' ', 'The thinking behind this change\nwas not purely altruistic. There was an awareness that the Swiss bank sector\ncould only thrive if Swiss laws created a win-win situation between Switzerland\nand other nations, and that the country itself could not thrive if it was seen\nto be a rogue state in the middle of Europe. ', ' ', 'And it is here that this new\nSwiss policy becomes of great interest not only to Kenyans, but also to many\nothers in developing nations.', ' ', 'MAKING\nSURE CRIME DOESNT PAY', ' ', 'The Swiss Federal Department of\nForeign Affairs, Directorate for International Law, explains the new Swiss\npolicy in a document titled, Making Sure Crime Doesnt Pay: Repatriating the\nProceeds of Crimes as follows:', ' ', 'Assets\nillicitly acquired by Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) such as Heads of State\nand high public officials, who illegally enrich themselves through state funds,\ndeprive their state of capital and hinder the development of their country.\nThese so-called potentate funds are frequently sent out of the country and\ninvested in international financial centres. Switzerland has a fundamental\ninterest in ensuring that assets of criminal origin are not invested in its\nfinancial centre...Assets illicitly acquired by PEPs that manage to enter\nSwitzerland despite comprehensive precautionary measures have to be identified\nand repatriated to their country of origin.', ' ', 'This might seem like mere\neyewash, intended to deceive the citizens of those nations that have thus been\nsubjected to the depredations of ruthless dictators, their families and\nassociates. After all, there must have all along been some very specific\nfinancial advantages in permitting all those many Swiss numbered bank\naccounts to be opened within Switzerland. Both the banks and the country must\nhave seen some advantage in it. So why throw away a goose which had evidently\nbeen laying golden eggs all this time?', ' ', 'Well, such scepticism may have\nbeen valid in the early years of this shift towards transparency, but not\nanymore. Remember, this process started back in the 1980s, and in the 30 years\nsince, much progress has been made, and evidence of the serious intention by\nthe Swiss in this matter has been steadily gathering.', ' ', 'Here are two examples from\ndocuments provided by the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs:', ' ', 'And this is by no means the worst\nnews for those who would seek to hide their ill-gotten funds in Swiss banks.', ' ', 'The approach used by the Swiss\nauthorities has since evolved to include anticipatory freezing of funds:', ' ', ""During\nthe Arab uprisings of 2011, the Swiss government immediately took proactive\nmeasures and ordered the freezing of assets of the former rulers involved and\ntheir entourages without waiting for requests for mutual legal assistance from\nthe countries in question. Lacking a specific legal basis to do so, this was\nundertaken as an emergency measure based on the government's constitutional right\nto safeguard Switzerland's interests."", ' ', 'What all this means is that a\nmodern-day Mobutu or Houphouet-Boigny, intent on concealing his vast illicit\nfortune behind the safety of numbered accounts, would have to look elsewhere.\nAs the Swiss Federal Directorate for International Law explains: ', ' ', 'The\nstrict provisions of Swiss anti-money-laundering legislation oblige Swiss banks\nand all other financial service providers to identify not only the contracting\nparty, but also the economic beneficiary...Banks and other financial\nintermediaries are required by law to report all suspicious transactions and to\nblock immediately any account where there is suspicion of money laundering.\nSwiss banking secrecy provides no protection against the prosecution of\ncriminal offences either in Switzerland or in the context of international\nmutual assistance in criminal matters.', ' ', 'AND SO,\nONTO ANGLO LEASING', ' ', 'Of particular interest in this\ncontext is the Anglo-Leasing scandal, currently before the courts here in\nKenya, and therefore subject to the sub judice provisions of the law. But\nwhat is already in the public domain is that a fabulously wealthy family of\nKenyan Asians, the Kamani family, has been accused of playing a central role in\nthis giant scam, and a few of the relatives have already appeared in court to\nanswer charges related to Anglo Leasing.', ' ', 'This scandal  of alleged ghost\ncontracts  was initiated in the last days of the regime of retired President\nDaniel arap Moi, but extended into the early years of the Mwai Kibaki presidency\n(2002-13). It was initially brought to public attention by British High\nCommissioner Sir Edward Clay, perhaps the most storied foreign diplomat to ever\nserve in Kenya.', ' ', 'In this scandal, public funds\nwere alleged to have been stolen by direct payment for contracts that were\nnever honoured; for goods that were not supplied; at prices that were\nimpossible to justify; and to corporate entities that, basically, were\nnon-existent.', ' ', 'Whatever the truth may be in this\nmatter, the established fact is that there is roughly 2.0 million Swiss Francs\n(Sh206 million) currently held in frozen accounts in Switzerland, which are\njudged to be the fruits of fraudulent contracting by officers of the government\nof Kenya, in this matter. ', ' ', 'If the Kenyan courts were to finally\nget to the bottom of this matter, it would not only free the Swiss authorities\nto release  for use in Kenya  the sums that are currently in those frozen\naccounts. ', ' ', 'Possibly even more important than\nthe money to be refunded, is the signal it would send: It would encourage\nKenyas growth as a regional financial hub.', ' ', 'There is currently a Bill before\nParliament, which is supposed to facilitate the proposed Nairobi International\nFinance Centre. A final resolution to the Anglo Leasing scandal, through the\ncourts, would demonstrate that the Kenyan financial sector was governed by the\nrule of law, and not by the arbitrary whims of those who might be temporarily\nin power.', ' ', 'THE\nQUESTION OF SCALE', ' ', 'The problem, when it comes to repatriation\nof the proceeds of crime, is one of scale. The Swiss authorities may currently\nbe on standby to send back to Kenya the aforementioned Sh206 million. But by\nall accounts, that is but a small part of the money Kenya lost in the Anglo-Leasing\nscam: A very small slice of a very big pie.', ' ', 'The US Ambassador to\nKenya of the time, Michael Ranneberger, highlighted the magnitude  and sheer\nbrazenness  of this type of grand corruption, in a speech he gave in Nairobi\nback in 2006. ', ' ', ' ', 'He then went on to\nspeak of the Anglo Leasing scandal, which he said consisted of schemes\ninvolving several branches of the government, and which had robbed the Kenyan\ntaxpayer of some $700 million. It should be mentioned though, that not all this\nmoney necessarily found its way to Swiss numbered accounts. ', ' ', 'MORE THAN ALL THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE', ' ', ' These schemes had\nbeen designed to siphon off significantly more than that, but were only\npartially successful: Most were closed after details of their operations were\nexposed in the media.', ' ', ' ', 'In this context then, Kenyans can\nonly take limited consolation in the knowledge that 2.0 million Swiss Francs (Sh206\nmillion) held in suspect accounts believed to be related to this scandal, have\nbeen frozen by the Swiss authorities.', ' ', 'It has now been over 10 years\nsince Kenyans heard of Anglo Leasing, and the broad public consensus has long\nbeen that there was a massive fraud involved in these various contracts\ncollectively termed as ""Anglo Leasing"".
