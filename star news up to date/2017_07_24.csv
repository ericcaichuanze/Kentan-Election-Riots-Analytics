Opposition strategists decided that the only way to achieve this objective is to create the local and international perception that the IEBC is unable to conduct a free, fair and credible election. They then identified four key areas to build their case on; registration of voters, access to polling stations, casting and counting of ballots and the declaration of results. The courts would be their playground to achieve their objective.', 'NASA first moved to court to question the declaration of presidential results at the national tallying centre. The idea was to discredit the declaration of results and counting of ballots. They argued that the presidential tally should be done by the constituency presiding officer, and not the chief returning officer at the national level, in this case the IEBC chairman. In one of those decisions that make one agree the law is an ass, they won and the courts decided that presidential results declared at the constituency level are final! AfriCOG, an NGO closely associated with the interests of NASA, also went to court seeking orders that the IEBC be compelled to publish the voters register online. The idea here was to discredit the voter register. AfriCOGs argument is in line with NASAs claims that the electoral commission is acting illegally and in contravention of the Election Laws (Amendment) Act 2016, by not making public the audit of the registered voters.', 'UN Special Rapporteur Maina Kiai, who is also allegedly associated with NASA, also went to court suing the IEBC for allegedly flouting rules in the importation of biometric voter identification devices. The idea was to discredit access to polling stations. In another multi-pronged effort to disorganise the entire voting process, NASA filed a suit against the decision of the IEBC to award the tender for the supply and delivery of ballots to Dubai-based Al Ghurair Print and Publishing Company. They also moved to court accusing the IEBC of failing to ensure there is complementary electronic technology as backup as required by the law, and demanded for the postponement of the August 8 polls at some levels until this is done.', 'To understand the strategy NASA is using, one must go back to the last general election. In 2013, NASA leadership  other than Bomet Governor Isaac Rutto, who was then in the Jubilee coalition  lost the presidential election. They did not accept that they had lost fairly and instead chose to blame the Judiciary, the IEBC and the security forces. Between 2013-17, these same politicians have done everything they can to paralyse these institutions.', 'We must also understand that NASA badly wants to be in government. However, they know that if the Kenyan people are allowed to practice their democratic right to chose who they want to lead them, they will never choose NASA. So they have looked at their options. In the past, they have used violent street protests quite effectively to achieve their objectives. They also have a history of exerting international political pressure on a duly elected President, and forcing themselves into power through a coalition government. This is the 2017 NASA playbook.', 'NASA has, therefore, done everything possible to use the courts to ensure there will be no election on August 8. The idea is that on August 8, they will run to the courts and argue that President Uhuru Kenyattas term ended the previous day, thus creating a constitutional crisis. In this confusion they can then call for their usual mass action and in the ensuing chaos, force Jubilee to accept the establishment of a caretaker government  also known as Nusu Mkate. Unfortunately for them all their efforts have failed. Kenya will have an election on August 8.', '\n']"

I reflected on how this visit has in many ways single-handedly reset the China-Africa narrative. As I listened to Jack recount how he had raised $60,000 (Sh6.23 million) in 1999 to set up Alibaba in his apartment and then reflected on the fact that today Alibaba is valued at $377 billion (Sh39.13 trillion), I went back to Joseph Schumpeter. ', 'Schumpeter spoke of creative destruction (German: schopferische Zerstorung), sometimes known as Schumpeter\'s gale, which is a concept in economics that speaks to a ""process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one""', 'And what is clear to me is that a new economy is emerging wherever I look and the velocity [and even violence] of its emergence is plain breathtaking. Look at something like Netflix which disrupted Blockbuster, look at Amazon which started by selling books and now sells just about everything. ', 'I also learnt that 29 per cent of UK retail sales are now transacted on-line and the direction of travel remains on-line. ', 'When Jack Ma was asked about the infrastructure deficit in Kenya, he said this [turning to Bob Collymore]', ""''But your internet is fast!'' "", 'And what he was saying was look at this new information highway because it is a disruption and an infrastructure all of its own. More importantly, Kenya has embraced the internet economy. Soon every Kenyan will own a smartphone. Mobile money is a Kenyan phenomenon. Sportspesa came out of nowhere. The ingredients for baking a high velocity internet economy are all in place. Whether the rate cap law is reversed or not is now by the by. The digital disruption is upon us. Physical branches will increasingly be liabilities and no longer assets on the balance sheet. Millions of Kenyans will have bank accounts but never ever set foot in a branch. It is going to be increasingly all about algorithms and algorithmic banking and large scale artificial intelligence. All these shopping malls [unless they are a compelling proposition] will soon look and feel like legacy assets. There is no reason why on-line sales should not reach the UK average of 29 per cent within 24 months. Think about that. We should be pronouncing the last rites.', 'Just like Jack Ma created $377 billion (Sh39.13 trillion) of value out of nowhere, there will be entrepreneurs who will ride this new economy and who are going to create fabulous fortunes.

An estimated one billion people live with what is more commonly known as high blood pressure. Of these, more than nine million die from the condition each year.', 'When hypertension is not treated properly, sufferers develop cardiovascular diseases such as strokes, heart attacks or kidney failure.', 'Cardiovascular diseases  and particularly hypertension  have traditionally been diseases associated with an ageing population. It mainly affects people over the age of 40.', 'In Africa these diseases have tracked the wave of western lifestyle practices sweeping across the continent: rapid urbanisation and people indulging in bad diets with fast foods and little to no exercise.', 'On top of this, Africa faces a unique challenge. As anti-retroviral treatment is rolled out to everyone living with HIV, and general improvements in health care take place, life expectancy is increasing. The incidence of hypertension is therefore likely to rise. Its projected that 75 per cent of older people will be hypertensive in low and middle income countries by 2025.', 'But few large studies have explored hypertension in Africa. Anecdotal evidence collected by researchers suggest the actual burden of the disease is poorly understood: people dont know that they suffer from the condition and therefore dont seek treatment.', 'We set out to establish whether people knew they had the condition and if they did, whether they controlled their blood pressure. We did a survey in four countries: Burkino Faso, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, looking at both rural areas and the peri-urban settings in the cities of Nairobi and Johannesburg.', 'Our study shows hypertension is a critical health problem in Africa. The picture it paints is that there are stark differences in the prevalence, awareness and control of high blood pressure on the continent. Ultimately there is a need for regionally tailored intervention.', 'Although hypertension can easily be detected by routinely measuring blood pressure, the reality is that across the regions studied, up to half of the population are unaware of their condition. And of those who are aware, up to half of them show poor control through treatment.', 'Vast differences', 'We found that some parts of the continent are worse than others. In South Africa, for example, up to 50 per cent of the people between the ages of 40 and 60 suffered from high blood pressure. In rural Burkino Faso though, there was only a 15 per cent prevalence.', ' In addition, there were also stark difference in different settings in the same countries. And in some areas despite treatment being high, peoples blood pressure was not under control, raising questions about the effectiveness of their treatment and how well they stuck to drug regimens.', ' It shows that health promotion needs to be improved to increase awareness but more importantly that better access to care, and infrastructural changes to existing primary health care facilities are required for treatment to improve, and for it to be adhered to.', 'As part of our survey we measured the blood pressure of people between the ages of 40 and 60 from rural areas in east, west and South Africa as well as two peri-urban areas in the cities of Nairobi and Johannesburg.', 'Hypertension rates were low in West Africa, higher in East Africa. Prevalence ranged from 15 per cent in West Africa to 25 per cent in East Africa, and between 42 per cent and 54 per cent in South Africa.', 'There are many reasons for these different rates.', 'East Africa, which has lower levels of hypertension, could be at this point because it is in the early phases of the epidemiological and health transition. But the risk here is that as people gain more access to fast foods, and live more sedentary lifestyles, hypertension rates could spurt.', 'South Africa on the other hand has the highest prevalence of hypertension on the continent. Diets are rich in refined and fast foods, lifestyles are sedentary, and obesity is a norm. It also has the largest number of people whose blood pressure is still not controlled despite them being on treatment.', 'In addition to the differences in hypertension rates across the continent, there were other differences too. Gender is one example.', 'Only 40 per cent of the men who suffered from hypertension were aware of their condition. And of those who were aware and on treatment, only 39 per cent had controlled blood pressure.', 'Women, however, were more aware of their condition (54 per cent) than men and just over half of those undergoing treatment had controlled blood pressure. This is a common observation thats common in many studies of hypertension across the continent.', 'Why there is this difference between men and women is unclear. One answer could be related to the higher levels of employment of men, who will subsequently have limited access to health care outside of their working hours.', 'Improving the data sets', 'Assessing the burden on the continent is challenging because of the paucity of data on hypertension from different African countries. But our study provides actual baseline data for older adults. The next step is to engage with these participants in five years again in a follow up study.', 'This will help us assess the main drivers and consequences of hypertension in the different regions. At that point we will examine how many new cases of hypertension have arisen and interrogate the health status and genetic background of participants with long standing hypertension. We will be able to evaluate how these changes may be related to the environment.', 'Most importantly though non-communicable diseases, including hypertension, must be prioritised and managed to reduce the public health burden and to avert a new epidemic on the African continent.', 'By Stuart Ali - Researcher at the Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, and AWI-Gen Project Manager, University of the Witwatersrand - and Francesc Xavier Gomez-Olive Casas -Research Manager at MRC/Wits Agincourt Research Unit, University of the Witwatersrand.

A man accused of torture in his home country of Gambia has been arrested and is undergoing trial, in what could mark a significant development in the international justice system.', 'Swiss authorities, acting under the principle of universal jurisdiction, took into custody Gambian politician Ousman Sonko, who was in the European country as he applied to Sweden for asylum.', 'Sonko served as Interior minister between 2006 and 2016 in the government of President Yahya Jammeh, defeated in elections early this year. The 48-year-old joined the military in 1989, later served as Inspector General of police before being appointed Interior minister in October 2006, a position he held until September last year.', 'After he was removed from office, Sonko fled to Sweden, where he applied for residency. He moved to Switzerland in November last year after Sweden declined his request. Swiss authorities arrested him in January this year. At the time of his arrest he was living in an asylum-seeking centre. He was remanded for three months while the allegations against him were investigated. His detention was extended by another three months in May.', 'The circumstances and legal arguments of his arrest warrant attention from students of international law and international relations.', 'A human rights group, TRIAL International, filed a complaint against him on the basis of human rights violations.', 'TRIAL operates in 10 countries where it says impunity is widespread and ongoing. In addition, it files cases in many other countries, usually with the support of local NGOs. TRIAL also runs the Trial Watch online database, which monitors thousands of criminal cases under international law around the world.', 'In its complaint against Sonko, the organisation argued that a state is usually competent to judge crimes if they have been committed on its territory, or by or against its citizens. However, the nature of international crimes is so serious that they constitute offences against all humankind, thereby warranting special measures.', 'Among these is the principle of universal jurisdiction, based on the notion that the fight against impunity is borderless. Under this principle, states have the option  and sometimes the obligation  to prosecute criminals who are on their territory, regardless of where the crimes may have been committed or of the nationality of the perpetrators and the victims.', 'The International Criminal Court at The Hague, The Netherlands, is no longer the only place to go for international crimes. The ICC, which is heavily dependent on financial contribution from rich countries, has had a low prosecution record of the cases it has handled. It is this dependence that has led to accusations that the court is a weapon of the West, which has been used mainly against African governments.', 'In the Kenya cases against President Uhuru Kenyatta, Deputy President William Ruto and four others, shoddy or no investigation was cited as the reason for the failure to provide tangible evidence against the suspects, despite claims by the Prosecutor of non-cooperation by the Kenya government.', 'But this protracted ICC process does not have to be, if other countries adopt their so-called universal jurisdiction responsibility, to detain and try perpetrators of international crimes. The ICC can initiate a case if it is directed to by the UN Security Council. It can also on its own volition initiate a case against individuals in a country that is a member of the ICC, what is called proprio motu.', 'But for universal jurisdiction, all you need to do is to make a complaint and the evidence can come later. For the Sonko case, he was first taken into custody before TRIAL took statements from two people who were allegedly victims of torture under the then Interior minister.', 'And you never know where it will be applied. A person can travel to, say, Belgium and be detained based on a complaint by a singe individual who provides reasonable probability of involvement in war crimes or international crimes.', 'The world is becoming smaller for perpetrators of international crimes who will soon have nowhere to hide.', '\n']"

We will not have peace because we have not earned it, because we do not deserve it.', 'Peace is not simply about the absence of violence. It is defined by the presence of fundamental liberties and the prevalence of economic opportunities. We will not settle for a perfunctory peace that is disrupted every five years by an election cycle. So declared Uhuru in his inaugural address four years ago following yet another divisive election. Yet, as the all-pervasive fear shrouding us today reveals, we did settle for a perfunctory peace, which is no peace at all.', 'We have done none of the hard work required for peace.

The best we can hope for is the absence of violence and the extension of the fragile ceasefire.', 'Therefore, the current debate over whether we should prefer peace to the injustice of a sham election is somewhat misplaced - peace is not on the table.

Wananchi have to endure the violence of poverty; of hunger; of state incompetence and oppression and murder and disappearing; of terrorism. The added violence elections bring exponentially increases their hardships and suffering while only slightly inconveniencing those in whose names the fighting is done. So, yes, let demand a credible election. But we shouldnt delude ourselves that this will preserve peace.', 'There is no peace to preserve. There is not even absence of violence for most. Lets not talk about peace unless we really mean it. Not unless we are serious about addressing, not just the potential injustice of a rigged poll, but all the injustices of the past whose bitter and painful consequences Kenyans are forced to live with every day.', 'Lets not talk about peace unless we are ready to confront the injustice of inequality, of poverty, of hunger, of dependence on handouts, of the deprivation of rights, of the institutionalising of ignorance through the public education system.', 'No, my friends. Lets not talk of peace. Lets say what we really mean. We want calm. We want life to go on pretty much as it has over the last four years and over the half-century before that.

Kingi added, deliberately withheld the funds to sabotage the development agenda in his and other counties.', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'The delayed disbursement of funds, Governor Kingi claims, has crippled the completion of projects within his county.', ' ', 'However, is his claim that the national government is withholding more than KSh800 million every year for four years true? PesaCheck looked into the facts and we find the claim to be FALSE.', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'In the last four years, the Senate allocated Kilifi County a total of KSh28.76 billion as shown above.', ' ', 'We have information on disbursements for the full year through 2015/16. Gazette notices from the National Treasury indicate the money disbursed to counties mainly from the Equitable Share, but also including a small amount for DANIDA grants to county health facilities. Other conditional grants are not included. These show that the Treasury disbursed to Kilifi County KSh5.443 billion in the financial year 2013/14, KSh6.505 billion in the financial year 2014/15 and KSh7.457 billion in the financial year 2015/16.', ' ', ' ', 'In other words, this data from the Treasury shows that the equitable share allocated to Kilifi County was disbursed in full (column: exchequer issues) in the first three years.', ' ', 'If there is any money that was not disbursed to Kilifi during the period claimed by the governor, it would have to come not from the Equitable Share, but from other conditional grants. This data is not as easy to find, however.', ' ', 'While we have data on conditional grants disbursed for the financial year 2015/16, we do not have data for the years 2013/14 and 2014/15 on disbursement. However, the total allocation for conditional grants for the first 3 years (KSh771 million) is less than the total amount that the governor says has been withheld.', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'The total allocations in conditional grants for the three years is KSh770.766 million while the disbursements from the data we have is KSh348.571 million. The difference is KSh422.195 million, which is the maximum that could have been withheld from Kilifi over this period. We have no evidence this money was withheld, but we have no way to confirm if the money was disbursed due to absence of actual data from the Treasury, Controller of Budget or concerned ministries.', ' ', 'We have not looked at the most recent year (2016/17) because the full year data for what was disbursed in terms of equitable share and conditional grants is not available. However, given the figures from the previous years, it is clear that the county is not accumulating KSh800 million per year as pending disbursements from the national government as claimed by the Governor. The total figure of KSh422.195 million for the period from 1st July 2013 to 30th June 2016 is way below the annual KSh800 million in balances claimed by Kilifi Governor.', ' ', 'Therefore, the information we have definitively shows that the national government is not withholding KSh800 million every year for the County Government of Kilifi.

TV debates between electoral candidates are invariably little more than a cosmetic exercise. Few candidates ever deliver a knock-out blow to their opponent. There is little evidence that broadcast debates actually alter the minds of voters. In fact, they are much more likely to simply entrench existing views.', 'Having said that, broadcast debates are a useful tool for engaging the electorate. But fortunately in Kenya, we have a public that is already extremely invested in political discussions. As such, perhaps the absence of custom-made television soundbites is no bad thing. It means that public attention can remain focussed on the real debate, the real choice facing our country on August 8.', 'It is a stark choice between two presidential hopefuls. Any rational analysis of the candidates tells a clear story. One has a clear record of spearheading progress for this country. The other has a track record that is not only devoid of achievement, but is intrinsically tied to some of the darkest chapters in our history.', 'President Uhurus last four-and-a-half years at the helm speak volumes. Countless women and their babies have benefitted from free maternal healthcare. Millions of Kenyans have seen their horizons expanded exponentially by being connected to the electricity grid. Meanwhile, newly paved roads and a high-speed railway are making this country more accessible and profitable. In just a short space of time, Uhuru has fixed so much of what has been holding Kenya back.', 'But in contrast, Raila has been in government for decades, with precious little to show for it. Can anyone list the signature achievements or projects from his five years as Prime Minister?', 'And even though Raila served as Roads minister, it appears that Uhuru has been left to pick up the pieces, paving a massive 9,000km since taking office. Meanwhile, the Kibera area, which Raila represented in Parliament for more than 20 years, remains destitute, left to live off Railas empty promises of improvement.', 'Lack of achievement would be bad enough, but Railas long career in public service is also synonymous with some of the most damaging moments in our recent history.', 'Raila has manifestly failed to explain his involvement in the 1982 coup attempt against the Moi government, an act of subversion that cost hundreds of Kenyan lives. And in 2007, his call for mass action was a trigger to the tragic violence that ended so many lives and turned Kenyans against one another. Railas record is also plagued by scandal, as noted by the television debate moderators. The various episodes associated with his name  the Kisumu Molasses Plant, Triton Oil and the Kazi Kwa Vijana programme  have become shorthand for the corruption problem still facing this country.', 'And so it is no wonder that Railas plans, should he enter State House, spell yet more danger for this country. He has pledged that within 100 days in office, he would do away with the direct election of President in favour of an undefined hybrid parliamentary system. This is nothing less than the destruction of the social contract between the people and the President and as such, our very democracy itself.', 'Meanwhile, as he reiterated on stage, Raila also insists that he would pull Kenyan troops out of Somalia. This reckless scheme would endanger Kenyans, bringing al Shabaab closer to their homes. It would also seriously damage our foreign relations with regional and international allies committed to tackling terror.', 'All these contrast sharply with Uhurus determined plan for progress, if he is reelected. It includes a nationwide programme of youth internships, which already has the backing of big business. And it also promises to bring free secondary education for all, and an expansion of maternity healthcare, initiatives that have already been valued. In short, Uhuru is offering a realistic yet ambitious blueprint for all Kenyans to progress.', 'If anything, the circus surrounding television debates tends only to muddy the clear waters. They allow slick rhetoric and attention-grabbing phrases to blur what is a very clear choice for the electorate. Even without the aid of a staged televised event, anyone who cares to give even a cursory glance at the respective records and plans of the two presidential candidates will see a clear choice between two contrasting future paths for our country. It is either Uhuru the fixer, or Raila the destroyer.', '\n']"

""When children go through the court process, they are taken to Kirigiti Girls\' Rehabilitation Centre, which in turn supplies the children to us,"" Clara said.', 'There have been instances where she has had to send back parents who brought children they said were uncontrollable at home. ""Parents drive in here in big cars. Rich people wanting to give us their children to tame, but I always send them back and tell them this is not an approved school. I advise them to start a court process if they indeed feel they cannot control their children,"" she said.', 'Clara said dysfunctional families in most cases make such children end up in juvenile centres.', 'FORMAL TRAINING', 'At the institution, the girls are taken through the formal primary school training. ""This is actually a school. We have the 8-4-4 system with trained teachers and we compete with neighbouring schools,"" Clara said.', 'Since most of the girls joining the institution are older than the classes they get enrolled to, the institution introduced vocational training, where they engage the children in beadwork, mat making, tailoring and catering.', '""You can get a 12-year-old child who has never stepped into a classroom, forcing us to enrol them in nursery school. Such a child may be academically challenged, so we get all of them to participate in extra curriculum."" The products they make are sometimes sold to parents and guardians during school visits, and the money goes back to the institution. ', 'At the institution, every child is treated as an individual and with dignity. ""These children are all unique and valuable human beings,"" Clara said, adding that the children get some time out but with close observation.', 'There are an estimated 12,000 children in the juvenile justice system countrywide. The 11 rehab/correction centres hold those who have gone through the judicial process and are minor offenders.', 'There are two borstal institutions that hold the serious offenders. There is Shikusa Borstal Institution in Kakamega and Shimo la Tewa in the Coastal region, Muthoka said. Borstals hold boys from age 15 to 18 for a maximum of three years, depending on the gravity of their offences.', 'If children are taken to juvenile rehabilitation centres and they become a bother, we refer them to borstals. They hold the hardest boys, Muthoka said. There are also 14 remands and four rescue centres for children.', 'SIDEBAR:', 'Education a click away as rehab school gets computer lab', ""When we visited the Dagoretti Girls' Rehabilitation School, a group of the girls were studying in the computer lab, which was recently set up by MTN."", 'The MTN Kenya team was on the ground inspecting the lab, which they set up last month during their 21 days of yellow care.', ""The '21 days of yellow care' is a programme launched in 2007.

""Weve been harnessing our technology to improve the youth\'s access to education,"" he added.', 'The lab is furnished with 11 computers, all installed with digital learning material for the pupils.', 'Each computer has at least 50 e-books and videos for vocational learning. E-kitabu were the providers of the books. ""We have computer lessons and we always come here and learn,"" one girl said.', 'Since most of the teachers were not well conversant with computers, MTN took them through training to enable them to teach using the computers. ""We do appreciate what they have done for us,"" Clara said.', 'Other institutions that have benefited from the programme include Maralal Primary School and Kabete Rehabilitation Centre for boys.', 'MTN also installed fibre connectivity to Upper Hill and Nairobi schools, but here, they charge a small fee that goes to a bursary kitty to assist two needy boys in each school.', 'LAPTOPS PROJECT', 'During the campaigns ahead of the 2013 general election, the Jubilee team manifesto highlighted the promise to provide laptops to every primary school class one pupil.', 'The promise would, however, delay for more than three years, and only 11,500 pupils from 150 schools received tablets, laptops and projectors during the Sh19 billion pilot project, which was rolled out last year.', 'In December 2015, digital content for standard one pupils was launched. The digital content is for mathematics, science, social studies, English and Kiswahili subjects. Others are interactive animations, videos, audios, cartoons, exercises and quizzes that have been used to improve the learning experience.', 'All public primary schools were given Sh1.32 billion to put up storage facilities for the laptops. ', 'Education CS Fred Matiangi last year was quoted saying that all schools were given the cash to build secure rooms for the sake of security.', 'Given a total of 22,000 public primary schools, this means each school received Sh60,000.', 'Schools have been given the cash to build storage rooms. That is why we are following them to find out if the money has been spent well, Matiangi said.', 'Some parents have been transferring their children to schools selected for the pilot project.', 'In Nairobi county, the schools selected are Roysambu Primary School in Kasarani, Ndurarua Primary in Dagoretti and Bidii Primary School in Embakasi.', 'Mombasa county has four pilot schools, namely Mwijabu and Port Reitz in Changamwe, and Kisauni and Sparki in Mombasa.', 'In Kisumu county, the four pilot schools picked are MM Shah, Kibos, Nyabondo and St Elizabeth Bar Korwa.', 'The pilot schools in Baringo are AIC Visa Oshwal Primary, Kabarnet Special, Moi Kabartonjo Primary and Esageri AIC Boarding Primary School.', 'Kenyatta University, Dedan Kimathi University, Moi University, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and the University of Nairobi were among the selected firms to deliver the Jubilee pet project.', 'Kenyans will be waiting to see what happens to the laptop project after the August 8 general election, depending on which political outfit carries the day.', '\n']"

How can a grandee be so strong yet so weak?', 'He is weak, frail and wounded because he has chosen to snub history. He has blatantly ignored the betrayals in his political life, driving himself into the rat trap, taking the bait and accepting to stay on the edge of the cliff, gazing at his eventual destruction.', 'Raila has surrounded himself with the same people who rocked his boat at the last minute, not once but twice. He somehow expects the political god of mercy to intervene and miraculously change these opportunists into saints! The truth is, checkmate, it wont happen!

Kalonzo represented Kitui North, which later became Mwingi North, from 1985 to 2013. In 2007, he denied Raila a direct win by running away with the ODM Kenya party. Through the now-famous kati kati move, he earned himself the Vice President position, while Raila had to literally fight for a piece of the cake  the Prime Minister position.', 'There is absolutely no difference between the political manoeuvres witnessed 10 years ago and the ones happening now.

Before ODM-K, he had been a member of Railas LDP, which he abandoned in 2006 to join the Julia Ojiambo-led Labour Party of Kenya, where he trounced Ojiambo in a secret ballot to become the presidential candidate.

Eventually, Musalia went it alone, denying Raila the crucial Western vote.

The thinking here is that the Jubilee government must be stripped of powers. The main question is why there is so much determination to send Raila home in the guise of removing Jubilee from power. In this arrangement, Raila is promised sweeping powers and the coveted position of a respected statesman. The ultimate beneficiaries are the two gentlemen and their ilk.', 'I dare say Raila needs to abandon these political opportunists and immediately contact Uhuru for the following arrangement: ', 'One, create the position of the Prime Minister before this Parliament completes its term. This must not be in a post-election MoU. Raila will occupy this powerful position in a power-sharing arrangement between him, Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto.

Take Senator Gideon Moi to Uhuru, Governor Hassan Joho and Senator Moses Wetangula to Raila and Ruto will make his choices. Alfred Mutua will be crucial in replacing Kalonzo as the Ukambani strongman.', 'This arrangement will entrench the principle of democracy as it should be in highly polarised societies. It will foster a sense of inclusivity of Kenyan communities. ', 'Executive powers will be shared among more Kenyans, boosting the sense of patriotism as more Kenyans will feel represented in government. This will be the winning Kenyan political formula that will benefit all Kenyans.', 'Two, review the Constitution and reduce the many overlapping layers of representation by returning the executive ministerial positions to elected leaders who have a direct mandate from the people, mainstream the gender requirements in government, develop a Kenyan blueprint without losing sight of the implementation of Vision 2030 projects.', 'Its evident that whenever the people of the Lake region work together with those of Central Kenya, political temperatures in the country go down, and democracy ceases to be a negative concept of permanent opposition without a course, becoming a concept of representation and development.

The last time Raila worked with Uhuru, they won the NO referendum campaign in 2005, and won the YES referendum campaign in 2010.', 'Similarly, whenever the Central people work with their Rift Valley counterparts, there is peace and tranquility in the conflict-prone Rift.

What is definitely for sure is that it is not a local ship, he said.', 'Bita said that a similar ship with same kind of materials was found in Namibia in 2008 and these materials are now a big attraction in Namibia, for both museum collection and research.', 'Mombasa-based archaeologist Hans- Martin Sommer says sometimes the shipwrecks were as a result of navigation errors or insufficient nautical charts. In other falls the ships were attacked by the Teredo worm, a wood boring bivalve that is the most common and destructive ship worm.', 'The special situation of Malindi as the capital of the ""Melinde"" kingdom and the first and only hospitably place for the Portuguese at today\'s Kenyan coast makes this town interesting for the maritime research, Sommer says in his paper, Portuguese Shipwrecks at the Kenyan Coast, published in 2007.', 'He worked with NMK as a research scientist in Mombasa between September 2005 and July 2008.', ' NMK says it will build Africas first underwater museum at the coast to let the public visit the shipwrecks.', 'Bita said there will be one museum underwater and another on land.', 'If the government will provide enough funding for graceful moving to the sites, study and working on them, then, we are likely to earn a lot of money from these sites, he said, adding that they have not tabulated the cost.', ' Development of an underwater museum is not like making a normal land based museum. More surveys need to be done to get more information and materials for use in the museum. It is when these are done we can make the budget estimates.', 'He observed that the tourism sector is going to benefit more from the projects.', 'Tourism is going to benefit big time once the sites are fully developed into underwater museums. This will make Kenya the first country in Africa to have such museums.', 'The archaeologist said that he was optimistic that Kenyans and foreigners will visit the wrecks.', 'If for example we charge our tickets US$200 per person we are going to make a lot of money. This is excluding other equipment that they will hire, he said.', 'He said that the shipwrecks have attracted a lot of income in some countries and reduced unemployment.', 'Developed sites in the United Kingdom attract at least more than six million visitors a year. In China, over 100 million visitors are going to the sites and this translates to a lot of money, he said.', 'Bita said the low tourist season will be helped with students who come to do research.', 'I believe that once our sites are fully developed are going to attract many researchers from across the world and we are not going to only concentrate on Beach and Safaris, he said.', 'We are likely to have marine biologists who maybe wanting to study organisms that eat timber that is underwater like ship worms. Others will want to learn about the ships state of preservation.', 'He however observed that the archaeological projects are faced with numerous challenges.', 'Challenges are many when working underwater. Such works are subject to favorable sea conditions. Our sea is suitable for such work in the period October  February so we have to wait for this time, he said.', 'Shortage of archaeologists in the country was another problem. The work needs experts but they are unfortunately very few in this country.', 'Bita said that treasure hunters were also a danger to the existing sites.', 'Some people are stealing metals from our metallic ships. This is common in Mombasa. The government has however put security measures to safeguard these sites, he said.', '\n']"

We have in the last couple of years seen an unprecedented number of person come out of the closet openly expressing their sexual orientation. We saw a head mistress chase away some of her boarding school students from school the other day since they were practising lesbianism. We must no longer bury our heads in the sand. What will you do when your daughter boldly tells you on the face that she is a lesbian? Information is power. How many families discuss matters sexuality in our homes? We must play our role as a nation in guiding our children to uphold the family values. You cannot lay any useful role nor exercise parental responsibility as a parent if you are not empowered and or informed morally, socially or otherwise.', 'I would like to draw a very clear line here. Knowing about issues of sexual orientation does not mean practising that which you do not subscribe to.', 'Allow me to use this platform to tell you the little that I know about this complex concept known as lesbianism. It is homosexuality in women. It is a sexual attraction and sexual relations between women irrespective of age, religion or social standing. The relationship can give birth to a union whichthe lesbians believe or treat as a marriage. They cohabit like a couple. This is allowed in some countries. In Kenya the Constitution recognises unionsbetween persons of the opposite sex under Article 45. There is no Statute in Kenya in force that gives any legal status or recognition to lesbians or couplesof the same sex. Our Marriage laws provide and recognise marriages between a man and woman exclusively and not same sex marriages.', 'In countries where lesbianism has been legalised and accepted, lesbians usually adopt children from third parties or their own children they mighthave had from previous marriages or out of wedlock. Some lesbian partners acquire children through artificial methods like test tube babies, artificialinsemination or surrogacy.', 'Lesbians cannot adopt children in Kenya. Under The Childrens Act of Kenya an adoption order cannot be made if the applicant or, in the case ofJoint applicants, both or any of them is a homosexual. Homosexuals include gays and lesbians. We have never had a case of lesbians asking the court toallow them to adopt children in Kenyan family court.', 'The Constitution has embraced Customs under Article 2.

Margaret used to assist and look after the deceased even when she was sick. The eight children knewPhilisilahs home as their home. ', ""Margaret 's father told the court that he had blessed the union and that all the ceremonies pertaining to a Kikuyucustomary marriage were conducted and in 1982 when the final wedding ceremony was celebrated (Ngurario). The Chief of Juja also testified and gaveevidence of the role he played between these parties marriage."", 'On the issue of woman to woman marriage the learned Judge was convinced that Margaret was actually married to Priscilla. The learned judge inhis informed judgement referred to, The Restatement of African Customary Law Vol. 1 at page 13  Eugen Contran which states;', 'Where a husband dies leaving a childless widow, who is past child bearing age, the widow may marry a wife. The widow pays ruracio to thefamily of the woman selected and arranges for a man from the deceased husbands age to have intercourse with her. Children resulting from suchintercourse are regarded as the children of the widows deceased husband.', 'It must be noted that this type of marriage union is not a sexual relationship as is the case with that of lesbians. It is a relationship that is well-rooted, practised and accepted in many Kenyan customs. This custom is exclusively tailored for purposes of granting a barren widow the joy of parentage.', 'That said, we must remain focused on Article 45 (1) of The Constitution which stipulates that the family is the natural and fundamental unit ofsociety and the necessary basis of social order, and shall enjoy the recognition and protection of the State.', '\n']"

She did not believe it.', 'I was living a very evil life, engaging in all the abominable acts mentioned in the Bible, but yet God remembered me? I wondered why, yet when I was a good Christian, faithful in my marriage and with enviable morals, he ignored me. But now, when I was fully immersed in sin, he remembered me?', 'Shocked to the bone, Lilian decided to sober up for the sake of her unborn baby. She packed all her belongings and moved back to Nairobi to start a new life.', 'She got back her old sales job at the bank, and began piecing her life together, which was not easy. I was used to men taking care of all my bills, but now I had to support myself and my unborn baby. It became very difficult to make ends meet, but I did not despair. My baby motivated me and kept me going, she says.', 'One day, in her seventh month of pregnancy, she noticed some blood stains. She rushed to hospital, and by the time she got there, her clothes were soaked in blood and she was writhing in pain.', 'An ultrasound done on the foetus revealed that Lilians baby was already dead. Lilian had faced high blood pressure issues during the pregnancy, which led to her having pre-eclampsia, a condition characterised by a high level of protein the urine and which can be fatal.', 'But she had to deliver the baby anyway, and after six agonising days, she finally gave birth. It was a baby girl. Even though I wanted to see her and hold her in my arms, the doctors refused and only showed me her legs. They said that because she had been dead for more than a week, she was already decomposed and in a bad state. I called her Zawadi, because she was my special gift, she says, struggling to contain the tears welling up in her eyes.', 'As she walked out of the hospital on that day in May 2012, Lilian left with a new resolve. To completely turn her life around and find her purpose in life again.', 'I dont blame anyone for the path I took in life. I am responsible for all the decisions I made. I could have made better choices, but I did not. I have forgiven myself and I am embracing my new life.', 'In January this year, Lilian formed a group for women struggling with infertility. The group is called Diamonds Women Ministry, and it brings together women struggling with infertility, and teaches them to focus on other areas of their lives even as they try for a baby.', 'The reality is that not all women struggling with infertility will have a happy ending where they will get pregnant and have babies. I encourage women not to be consumed by the search for a baby to the extent that other areas of their life suffers. They should also not peg their worth as women solely on the basis of motherhood. I talk to women during bridal showers and talk to newlyweds about marriage expectations. I always use my personal experiences because I know I contributed to the loss of my marriage and advice them not to make the mistakes I made. I am a strong believer in marriage and just because mine did not work, it does not mean that it will not work for another couple, she concludes.', ' ', '\n']"

Further, Kenyattas personality as a freedom fighter, just like much of independent African leadership, was built around fierce anti-imperialism rhetoric. ', 'And the soldiers thought he will be sympathetic to their plight, instead to resolve the problem sought Britishs help, and decision, led to a series of agreements with the British by which the former colonial power agreed to provide military support in the event of any domestic or foreign threat to Kenyattas government. ', 'For Kenyatta, the attempted mutiny became a perfect bogeyman deployed conveniently against any domestic opponents. Kenyatta elevated the presidency by making it the be all and end all, and effectively placing it above the law.

Even within the ruling party dissent was not tolerated. ', 'The party established a severe disciplinary committee to streamline the partys operations. Unlike Kenyatta who cared little about the political party, to Moi, the party was another avenue of control-a fulcrum around which he consolidated his rule, although it was by no means the only one. When all avenues were closed, the pro-reform movement went underground and some went into exile.', ' The West tolerated Mois domestic repression because Kenya was in the Western bloc. But the end of the Cold War changed the Western countries calculus regarding Kenya as a vanguard against communism, signaling the end of an era of tolerating Mois malfeasance. After years of refusing to allow multiparty despite relentless pressure, arguing, multiparty will deepen ethnic division and violence- a self-fulfilling prophecy because all the subsequent violence were state engineered, Moi begrudgingly accepted the introduction of multiparty.

But the truth is that this trip had very little to do with\nthe GES Summit (though this is not to say that there are no benefits to Kenya\nfrom the meeting). Obamas trip to Kenya was more about international bilateral\npolitics between Kenya and the US, continental and regional politics, and local\nKenyan politics. ', '\n', 'Internationally Obamas visit emphasised the importance\nAmerica places on its relationship with Kenya. On the continent, the visit raised Kenyas\nprofile amongst her peers. Regionally (within the East African Community) the\nvisit made Kenya the first amongst equals on key issues especially as regards the\ncivil war going on in South Sudan, the fight against terrorism and regional\ninfrastructure. In addition Kenya held the worlds attention for three days and\nbasked in much-needed positive international socio-political attention ... at\nleast for three days. ', '\n', 'However it is what Obamas trip means for Kenyas local\npolitics that is of interest. ', '\n', 'Let me first state that I believe that Obamas visit\nand the local political interpretations of what he did, what he said, and why, will\nnot only shape Kenyas politics between now and the next general election, but\nit will also substantially determine the election narrative. Obama has especially left Cord politically wounded on several\nfronts.', '\n', 'First, one of Cords main arguments against the Jubilee\ngovernment has been that they are illegitimately in office. Cord has deliberately\nsustained the (false) narrative that Jubilee did not win the last election and\nare only in office because Cord decided to honor a Supreme Court ruling. As I\nhave said before, this very dangerous propaganda as far as Kenyas pursuit for national\nunity is concerned has been sustained since the last election for the sole\nintention of keeping Cords strongholds united against Jubilee until 2017. It\nborrows heavily from the ODM script post-2007. ', '\n', 'Unfortunately Obama not only accepted to be hosted by\nthe man who stole Raila Odingas victory, he also went on to publicly state that as\nfar as the worlds only superpower is concerned Uhuru Kenyatta is legitimately\nin office! This has not only put to bed the often-repeated lie by the Cord on\nhow Jubilee stole the last elections, it has also dismantled Cords main 2017\nre-election strategy ... which was to call on CORD supporters to come out in\nlarge numbers and confirm the 2013 victory for Raila, in 2017. ', '\n', 'Second, Obama told Kenyans (and the world) that Kenyas\nopposition has nothing to offer. This is why he met them at the tail end of his\ntrip, after he had already done whatever brought him to Kenya, and once he was\ndone with addressing the Kenyan public. It was quite clear he did not expect\nthe opposition to add any value to his trip. This is why he dedicated only 30\nminutes of the close to 72 hours he was in town to Cord. He was being polite.\nClearly America does not believe Kenyas opposition can affect where Kenya is\ngoing in any way. ', '\n', 'Obamas public (and rather mischievous) remarks about\nthe hypocrisy of Kenyas opposition trying to report on their government to America\nwere very deliberate. He was telling Kenyans that these guys cannot be trusted,\nthey are wolves in sheepskins. That he chose to put down the opposition amongst\nthe Kenyan civil society, most of whom are perceived to prefer Cord to Jubilee,\nwas also quite strategic. It was a silent message to the CSOs: Change focus; figure\nout how to engage government; the Opposition is a non-issue in Kenya.  ', '\n', 'Third, Obama burst the anti-corruption and insecurity propaganda\nbubble Cord has been using against Jubilee. First he publicly confirmed that America\nbelieves that Jubilee is genuine in its war against corruption unlike what Cord\nhas been saying. Second he complimented the Kenyan government for its role in\nSomalia, again going against Cords agitation for KDF to leave Somalia. He then\noffered to help Kenya scale-up its security capacity.', '\n', 'Finally Obama threw in a bonus for Jubilee. He spoke\nabout the need for political leaders to change how they do politics; condemned dictatorship\nbased on longevity in political systems, and openly and publicly told Kenyans\nand the world that the future of Africa is in the hands of young (rather than old)\nleaders. ', '\n', 'Obama, a man Cord has owned and presented as their cousin\nin America came to town and publicly exposed Kenyas opposition for what they\nare: hypocrites. The best rebuttal from Cord was to claim that the President of\nthe most powerful nation in the world today was misled by a third world government.\nSince even Cords hardcore supporters do not believe this Kenyans should expect\neven more ridiculous statements from the opposition as they try wiggle out of\nthe mess Cousin Barry left them in.', '\n', 'Ngunjiri\nis a director of Change Associates, a political consultancy.', '\n']"

They come here to visit Mt Kenya, game parks and none of them are subject of travel advisories. We dont have a travel advisory on specific locations. ', ' ', 'How do you find Kenya? ', 'I love Kenya. I am here with my wife and two girls. My third child visited in July. My mother has visited. My family is doing its best to help in the Kenyan tourism industry. Its a fascinating place to be.

It is really a very worrying trend and had I not been an optimist, I would have believed it is the 'nations' curse."", 'Nowhere is this disunity displayed more than the political divisions that are now playing among the citys Kikuyu political elites with some not seeing eye-to-eye, while others have sworn not to even share a cup of tea, leave alone sharing the same platform.', 'These divisions were manifest in the city recently, during the mayoral election and the Kamukunji by-election, which were held a month apart in August and September. And the antagonists have already pitched their different tents, as the country readies itself for a much vaunted general election that President Kibaki, who steers away from any kind of political controversy indicated might be held in December and not, in August 2012, as the new constitution stipulates.', 'In one camp, there are two former MPs; Maina Kamanda, the immediate former MP for Starehe and his counterpart Dick Mwangi Wathika, who was trounced by the new kid on the block Gidion Mbuvi alias Mike Sonko, in a much publicised Kamukunji by-election that took place on September 20 last year. The other group is fronted by the rambunctious MP for Embakasi, Ferdinand Waititu and the soft-spoken septuagenarian Dagoretti MP and Minister for Public Health and Sanitation, Beth Mugo.', ""This obvious political antagonism has apparently sucked the two Kikuyu political giants Uhuru Kenyatta and George Saitoti considered in political parlance as a Kikuyu who has since been adopted by the Maasai community. According to Kikuyu nation political watchers, who are keenly following the community's politics- protagonists as well as its antagonists- the Kikuyu nations politics of Nairobi, which are quickly becoming the hotbed of the Kikuyu nations politics, may ultimately draw in the two as the fight for the control of Nairobi's political terrain gains impetus."", 'The fact of the matter is that there is indeed no love lost between the twoDeputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Uhuru Kenyatta and the indefatigable Minister for Internal Security George Saitoti. But that really is a story for another day. For now, the scope of this article will restrict itself to the infighting that is shaping up pretty fast among the four Kikuyu political elites, who at different times, have been influential in dictating the pace and rhythm of the Kikuyu nations politics in the city in the recent past.', 'Wathika, who is still smarting from his big defeat by Sonko told me that the battle is not between Uhuru and Saitoti per seinsofar as he is concernedrather between Kamanda and Mugo. They are merely extending their turf wars, which have existed since their Democratic Party of Kenya days, where over the years, the duo has sought to outdo each other as the Kikuyu political kingpin in the citys political sphere.', 'The rumour mills that have been spinning for quite sometime now, point to the fact that Wathika and Kamanda, who the other group of Mugo and Waititu refer to as losers, are allegedly being bankrolled by Saitoti, a notion Wathika vehemently denies. I can tell you here and now that Saitoti and I are not friends. We may belong to the same political party and we did meet a couple times in the corridors of Parliament, but thats just it. He is an acquaintance. My friend is Uhuru Kenyatta.', 'Wathika says that during his by-election campaign, it is Uhuru who showed up a couple of times in his Makadara constituency and threw his weight behind him and not Saitoti, who, despite being the chairman of PNU, my sponsoring party, never came anywhere near Makadara.', 'After his devastating lose, Wathika said he went for soul-searchingI must admit I did not see the defeat coming, I had had it too easy perhaps. He quickly re-emerged to publicly declare that he was going for the citys governor seat. A seat he wants to battle it out with his now political nemesis, Ferdinand Waititu. Waititu was Wathikas deputy mayor at City Hall, before both ventured into parliamentary politics.', 'Watching Wathikas body language as he talks about his former deputy in measured monologue, one does not fail to notice that they have since broken ranks and theirs is going to be a vicious gubernatorial war. Let me just say this, now that I was defeated, some people think that they can ride roughshod over everyone and were it not for the help they got, they would not be all over behaving like they own this city. Some people can be so thankless.', 'To prove who owns the city, when the mayoral elections were held in August 11 this year, Wathika who started his local politics as a councillor for Maringo ward in Eastlands on a Ford Asili Party ticket in 1992 graduating to a mayor for two terms from 2004 to 2006 on a DP ticket, allegedly teamed up with Kamanda another veteran of city politics to hand PNU candidate James Mwangi Gakuya alias Buda, a bitter defeat. Buda, alongside Waititu and Mugo, was vigorously involved in the Kamukunji by-election PNU Alliance campaigns.', ""There was so much bile in PNUs candidates defeat that Gakuya, who is the Shauri Moyo/Muthurwa ward councillor, swore that he would henceforth not have tea with Kamanda. Gakuya believes that were it not for the teetotaller Kamanda meddling, he would be the city's mayor today. Gakuya had smelt victory because ODM as a party was down because Geoffrey Majiwa the former mayor and its mayoral candidate was downafter being suspended over corruption charges."", 'Kamanda, just like Wathika, surprisingly lost in the Starehe by-election that was also simultaneously held on September 20, 2010, to the mercurial ODMs Bishop Margaret Wanjiru, the assistant minister for Housing. This defeat hit Kamanda hardnot after the recount of votes which he asked the court to grant him and which confirmed he had indeed won by a huge margin, the controversial 2007 general election notwithstanding.', 'So, to Kamanda, it was a matter of course that the repeat election was his for the taking. Thus, Bishop Wanjirus turning the tables against him was a complete setback and an angry political moment for Kamanda. Irrespective of the dynamics of this singular by-election, Kamanda was embittered that he had been neglected by PNU stalwarts who did not come to lend a hand, leaving him all alone to fight his own battle.', 'With his second straight defeat, Kamanda, to his political competitors and now rivals in the city, Ferdinand Waititu and Beth Mugo in not so many words, as in their actions, declared that he was finished and had nothing to offer. This behaviour was explicitly witnessed in the hotly contested Kamukunji by-election which was won by PNU Alliance candidate Yusuf Hassan.', 'As a veteran city politician, Kamanda was conspicuously absent from the PNUs campaign trail. Kamanda who believes Waititu celebrated his defeat avoided Kamukunjia constituency that borders histo the high visibility of Waititu and Mugo.', 'Kamanda was apparently piqued that it was the melodramatic Waititu and Johnny-come-lately that was now seemingly calling the shots. Waititu has of late been coming to me to seek my support in his political gamesmanship and when I needed his, he was nowhere to be seen, said Kamanda. He worked against me because he feared that if I am elected as MP, he would not have half a chance of being considered for a cabinet position.""', 'There was no pretence on the part of Kamanda of what he thought of Waititu: a man given to melodrama, who revels in unparliamentary activities such as stone-throwing and engaging in fistfights with the electorate. Kamanda in staying away from Kamukunji was simply not to share a platform with Waititu and his other political nemesis Beth Mugo. I did not have a problem with Yusuf, but I couldnt share a dais with those people, riposted Kamanda. As it is, Kamanda is preparing to battle it out for the senatorial seat with Beth Mugo.', 'Kamandas supremacy battles with Mugo started way back in the 90s when both were in DP. Maina who started his political career as a councillor in Starehes Ngara Ward, in the 80s and later joined Parliamentary politics, overtime built a network of political allies in the council politics to the extent that City Hall still has to reckon with his influence.', ""Suffice it to say that, when both Kamanda and Wathika allegedly decided they were going to participate in the recent mayoral elections, their influence was for sure felt and reckoned with. Kamanda's hold on the city politics is such that people like Joe Aketch, the long time deputy mayor and mayor, owed their positions to Kamanda. Kamandas influence at City Hall is still exerted by the fact that his brother is a councillor in Starehe constituency."", 'This is notwithstanding the fact that between Kamanda and Wathika, there is 40 years of City Hall political experience, intrigues and networks. Hence, Kamandas organisational skills and penetration, insofar as the local city council politics are concerned have remained unparalleled for a long time.', 'This coupled with the fact that Kamanda never oscillated in his allegiance to his party DP and its leader Mwai Kibakionce the country was declared a multi-party state in 1992implicitly made him feel he was the de facto senior city politician, more senior than Beth Mugowho not only joined active politics in 1997but has oscillated from DP to Ford Asili to SDP, before joining Narc and now like everybody else in the Kikuyu nation is in PNU, of course barring a few exceptions.', 'Without vocalising his disapproval of Mugo and their supremacy battles, Kamanda feels that since he is competing with Uhurus favourite cousin, Beth Mugo, she has deliberately ensured that he does not get to fraternise with the DPM. All this is to safeguard her turf and endear herself to the DPM, who hitherto holds the sway, as far as Kikuyu nation politics are concerned.', ""The battle ahead between Kamanda and Mugo for the Nairobi senators seat is expected to ignite fireworks and revive the age old rivalry between Kiambu county vis a vis the Murang'a/Nyeri axis, begun and nurtured during the nascent days of President Mzee Jomo Kenyatta regime. Kamanda is from Murang'a Countyas indeed many of the Kikuyu voters that straddle the city."", 'Kamanda and Wathika who hail from Mukurwe-ini in Nyeri county are promising to galvanise their people in a battle royal that hopes to fend off the Kiambu countys creeping influence in city politics fronted by Mugo and Waititu, whose rural origin is Limuru. Mugo, who is from Dagoretti area hopes to invoke and unleash the Kenyatta family brand namea label that evokes nostalgia and memories are made of this among the older Kikuyu folks who witnessed the independence of the country in 1963.', 'On the sides of these PNU political jostling, a quiet but calculative politician has emerged as the first among equalsStarehe MP Bishop Margaret Wanjiruthe evangelical prosperity gospel minister of the glory is here fame. Today, considered to be the ODMs point(wo)man in Nairobi, her dominant disposition in the recent Kamukunji by-election was evidently noticeable. When her party lost, she spontaneously picked up the gauntlet and addressed the partys supporters pleading with them to unilaterally accept the election results, which she termed as free and fair.', ""A cursory extrapolation of Bishop Wanjiru's speech at the YMCA hall where the votes were being counted told more than just a losers acceptance speech. Political pundits point to the fact she was in fact addressing the largest voting block in Kamukunji constituencythe Kikuyu, which stands at more than 42,000 votes. But more significantly Bishop Wanjiru was directly talking to the larger citys Kikuyu constituency, which forms the single largest voter block."", ""With her eyes firmly fixed on the city's political crystal ball, it does not need much intelligence to guess why Bishop Wanjiru would take the trouble to assuage and massage the Kikuyu constituency in Kamukunji and the larger Nairobi area. As it is, with her surprise and guerrilla tactics defeat of Kamanda, it would be a fatal mistake to politically presume her apparent innocuous moves."", 'With these emerging dynamics, it is less wonder that Nairobi is now being considered the microcosm and the heartthrob of Kikuyu nation politics. But as Wonderful reminded me of a Kikuyu proverbit is darkest before dawn, he hoped that maybe with all these troubling divisions and antagonisms among the Kikuyu nation, the fighting political elites will see the urge to unite and forge a united front ahead of the 2012 general elections.', '\n']"

He was in the country to conduct the Nairobi Orchestra on two concerts last weekend at the Braeburn theatre.

I have had a great time meeting young players and hope to grow the collaboration,"" Dummer said.

"", ' ', ' It is an interactive approach that has generated new audiences through direct communication between the conductor and the audience in concerts,"" Dummer said.', ' ', 'On this second visit to Kenya, he was impressed by the enthusiasm for this genre  previously banished as a colonial relic  by young native Kenyans.', ' ', 'However, he would like to see improved quality of teaching and increase of music teachers to attend to the growing need.', ' ', 'On choice of instruments, he would like to see greater variety of instrument learning to embrace the diversity of instruments played in local orchestras.', ' ', '""There is a strong preference for the clarinet and violins and I would like young students to take up the more unfamiliar instruments such as Bassoon and Oboe, which I feel are being neglected,"" Dummer said.', ' ', 'However, his long term passion is to see Kenya music being performed by local orchestras so as to infuse an authentic country character in its repertoire. I am hoping to develop twinning of my orchestra in London with the Nairobi Orchestra for mutual benefit,"" said Dummer.', ' ', 'Historically, orchestras have been associated with European classical music but more are tapping into their own folk music to expand their repertoire and create relevance to attract new audiences. ', ' ', 'Among the best examples of African compositions was in the late 1990s when the piece Dance of the Gazelles by Europe-based Congolese composer Ray Lema was widely performed by European Orchestras.

Only a handful of Africans have been nominated for this prize, and she was the first African-American woman to take home the gong.', 'As Nairobians went viral with the news and took to social media with their congratulatory messages, I observed something else; some enterprising Kenyans are still in a state of euphoria and have already begun to strategise on how to cash in on Lupitas success.', 'By now, you must have seen bootleg copies of everything she has ever done being sold in the streets.
