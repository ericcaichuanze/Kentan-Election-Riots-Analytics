That bold and unbelievable declaration in its own right has come to be borne out as, indeed, Trump did end up being elected President, despite losing the popular vote.

Kibaki won with 62.3 per cent of the vote, sending Uhuru home to lick his wounds with a face-saving 30 per cent. The voters, even Kikuyus who Moi tried so hard to woo, had had enough with the incumbent and it didnt matter that he fronted one of their sons to succeed him.', 'Question is, would the Kikuyus have given a non-Kikuyu anywhere near what Kibaki received had that person been the one Raila endorsed?', 'Empirical evidence beyond the scope of this column shows no.

But beneath the glitz and glamour lies a manifesto that calls for a total change of government, as we know it. And lets be clear. It is an entirely unnecessary change, only wholly self-serving. It envisages Raila as President and Kalonzo Musyoka as his deputy, as expected but beyond that, NASA is proposing nothing more than a naked reward system for the remaining Pentagon members.', 'A constitutional change would see Musalia Mudavadi take the reins as the Premier Cabinet Secretary in gratitude for the support of his ANC.

It is a proposal that will have enormous implications, undermining our democracy. According to NASA, the current one person-one-vote system, in which the Presidents legitimacy lies entirely on the people, encourages exclusivity. Maybe someone should tell Raila that this is precisely the point of democracy. The presidency should be the most exclusive office in the country. ', 'The presidential election is a popularity contest  It is called the will of the people. If the people do not entrust the President, then he or she has no right to govern, and maybe this is what worries Raila. Is he concerned that he might win and then lose public confidence? Is he looking for a way to retain office no matter what?', 'If we had clear answers on NASAs alternative system, perhaps it would allay such fears. But incredibly, the opposition coalition proposes no other system. The manifesto vaguely suggests a hybrid parliamentary system without providing any detail whatsoever. In other words, NASA is suggesting we dump our one person-one vote system, and place blind trust that Raila and his cohorts will do whats best for us all. Yeah right, of course they will.', 'Based on the proposed re-organisation of government, it is clear Kenyans can only trust NASAs leaders to do what is best for themselves. NASA can be relied upon to take the weighty step of changing the Constitution if it serves their interests. ', 'Raila wants us to gamble our democracy away to a group of politicians with no track record of delivering to the people. He wants us to believe that his coalition can be relied upon to re-shape the democracy, which is the lifeblood of our country.', 'NASA expects that we, the Kenyan people, will rip up the contract between the President and the people. They expect that we will consent to endangering the very future of our democracy. And in doing so, they presume we will open the door to an unidentifiable alternative.

The most pronounced are Kitui and Machakos counties, where deep political discontent is easily discernable, but has been swept under the carpet, or allowed to heal through political attrition within a reasonably short time.', 'In Machakos, the bone of contention was the political slap on Governor Alfred Mutuas deputy Bernard Kiala, who for four years was used to fight the incumbents administration by the Wiper high and mighty, with the tacit blessings and backing of its leader Kalonzo Musyoka.', 'Kiala became the public face of the onslaught on Mutua  instigated by Wiper  over political rivalry occasioned by the latters decision to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta and his government.', 'Under this arrangement, Mutua authored a symbiotic relationship for his Maendeleo Chap Chap model that seeks to enhance development in Ukambani at the expense of political rhetoric, setting himself up for a titanic battle with Kalonzo and purveyors of the political status quo in Ukambani.', 'While the general of this political battle on Mutua, one Johnson Muthama, backed Kiala all the way, the party and specifically its leader Kalonzo decided to guillotine the deputy governor politically through the backing of a belated recruit to Wiper, Wavinya Ndeti of Yaliyondwele Sipite fame.', 'The Kiala betrayal was two-fold: Although he was willing to be Wavinyas running mate, the Wiper high and mighty reportedly opted to back Peter Mathuki, the immediate former EALA legislator, for the role. This is despite the fact that both Kiala and Mathuki hail from Masinga constituency, Machakos county.', 'Then there is the political battle royale in Kitui county, pitting Governor Julius Malombe, former Wiper chairman David Musila and the evergreen iron lady of Ukambani Charity Ngilu.', 'Here, the challenge is playing out on three parallel fronts. Musila, with the backing of sitting MPs from Kitui, was seeking the Wiper ticket to unseat Malombe. The political body language and soul of Kalonzo was that Malombe was the preferred candidate.', 'In an intriguing battle and voter counting methodology  worse than that adopted and utilised by Kanu during the infamous Mlolongo voting system in 1988  Wiper declared Malombe the winner of the governor primaries, despite strong protestations from party diehards, who at best hoped for a repeat of the nomination.', 'And Ngilu, having had the luxury to interact with the people of Kitui and check the political mood of the community, outthought the grumbling Wiper men by enrolling for the NASA brigade through her Narc party.', 'This allowed her to force Kalonzo into a political dilemma  does he fight Ngilus bid and risk bad blood with NASA high and mighty?', 'The dilemma unfolded at Kabati market in Kitui West during a Wiper campaign rally, where Kalonzo was heckled over his stance on the governor poll in a county that has raised the political temperature.', 'Political analysts have variously opined that Ngilu is in NASA for political expediency in her bid to outsmart Malombe and Musila. And it may as well work for her at the expense of Wiper, despite the political experience and astuteness of Musila, and the development record rolled out by Malombe in the past four years.', 'The Kitui issue was complicated by the fact that Wiper had earlier ostensibly given direct tickets to all the eight sitting MPs in the hope that they would help Musila in his titanic battle against Malombe. Once they had safely crossed the Athi River with the tickets, the legislators entered the political comfort zone and left Musila to hang.', 'To rub the political pepper on the Kitui Wiper issues was the handling of the Woman representative nominations, pitting Mwende Kibati against Irene Kasalu.', 'During the 2012 Wiper nominations, Kibati lost to Nyiva Mwendwa by a paltry margin of 1,000 votes, triggering concerns that she had been rigged out. She was then reportedly promised Wiper backing four months to the poll, and persuaded to join the party as a platinum member.', 'Out of the blue, Kasalu emerged, got the backing of Kalonzo and was handed the Wiper ticket through what the Kibati team termed political impunity and vindictiveness. Kibati has since been cleared by the IEBC to run as an independent candidate, and it is expected or likely that she will trounce the Wiper nominee.', 'In Makueni, Wiper opted to give the governor ticket to incumbent Kivutha Kibwana, owing to his political experience. He left his Muungano Party for Wiper.', 'Political analysts have said Kibwanas blank political cheque to join Wiper was an astute political move by Kalonzo to deal a blow to Muthama, who has for the last 10 years broken political legs like a rogue hippopotamus.', 'With Kivuthas finesse, Ngilus street-fighting skills and Wavinyas polished political tongue, Kalonzo easily vindicated himself against allegations that he had finished his political generals for neophytes, at least for August 8. Kibwana may as well trounce his opponents in Makueni. The political fielding in Ukambani means that after these polls, there will be major realignments.', 'During the presidential campaign tour of the region this week, President Uhuru and Deputy President William Ruto said they were ready to work with Kalonzo after the election.

But the presidential vote will not be a walk in the park for ODMs Raila, as was the case in 2013.', 'Kalonzo handlers are fixated with a six-piece voting pattern for Wiper candidates, ostensibly to set themselves up for nominations.

But when it comes to political and economic knowledge of our society, we are often very badly off.', 'In many cases, we are told by friends and the media what they feel we ought to know and think, and we accept this as the gospel truth.', 'Not everything we hear is wrong, but never was there a time when it was more important for us to keep an open mind, to ask critical questions and to seek objective answers, without bias from preconceived notions.', 'This book by Raila Odinga, a leading Kenyan politician and reformer, is written with an open mind to seek answers to and shed light on what has been happening in Kenya, politically, socially and economically, since Independence, and to suggest a better way forward.', 'The book is written in easily comprehensible and straightforward, flowing English. It is not intended as a stick with which to beat Railas political opponents. Instead, it offers enlightenment through analysis and reflection, and gives thought-provoking answers to the question on the lips of almost every Kenyan today: Where did the rain start to beat us?', 'Railas analysis wades into history, uses similar experiences elsewhere to compare and contrast what has happened to us, and goes on to point out what we need to do to restore the deferred  not lost  dream we had at Independence, when we were full of optimism, hope, and faith in a bright future. ', 'The National Anthem we sang, as the Union Jack was lowered by the Duke of Edinburgh and our National Flag was raised by Jomo Kenyatta at midnight on December 12, 1963, was an anthem of faith in ourselves and commitment to our collective future in a society that fervently desired justice, peace, unity, liberty and prosperity, everywhere within our borders.', 'What happened to that dream? The dream is not lost. It is only deferred  thanks, as Raila points out, to those who have consistently struggled to recapture that old hope and optimism, and to build a democratic, just, fair and prosperous society.', 'He and others have worked for many years to liberate the people of Kenya from the yokes of political oppression, economic exploitation and social marginalisation. In farms, workplaces, professional offices and even prisons, seeds of hope have always been sown and re-sown by patriotic Kenyans who believe that a better Kenya is possible: The Kenya we deserve.', 'But this book is not about Raila per se or about any individual. It is about lost opportunities, and about the solutions Raila suggests will steady us as we regain our footing and reset ourselves on the path to prosperity.', 'The 2010 Constitution finally addressed these issues and laid down broad principles for lawmaking that would ensure equitable development, social justice, respect for human and peoples rights, the rule of law and devolved government.', 'Yet even with our new Constitution, things are not going well. Raila goes deeper to analyse what historically has been ailing our society, and where intervention is needed even under the new Constitution for universal life-enhancement.', 'He presents persuasive examples of other countries that have developed much faster than we have, and why this has been so. Even some of our peers in Africa are overtaking us, despite the fact that we had a good head start. Raila points out that, besides making the right economic choices in terms of trade and investments (which Kenya has not always done), these choices must be made on the solid bedrock of a society that is politically more equitable, just and inclusive, and these attributes can come only from good governance. The point is effectively made and well-illustrated. Amilcar Cabral, the revolutionary who sacrificed his life for the liberation of Cape Verde and Guinea Bissau, once said, Revolutionaries dont fight to liberate their societies because of the good and noble ideas they have in their heads. They do so to change the lives of the ordinary people for the better.', 'I remember the dark days of the Moi regime, when we used to meet clandestinely for hours, analysing the situation in Kenya and what we could do about it. This book offers some answers to those still pertinent questions, analysing why we are where we are today, where we ought to be, and the road we need to travel to build the Kenya we deserve. One point Raila makes is that the new Constitution is not the alpha and omega for solving all our political, social and economic problems. No Constitution can do that, because any constitution is only as good as its implementation.', 'Our colonial-inspired Independence Constitution was basically a document of convenience for the handover of power from the colonials to Kenyans. It was never approved by the Kenyan people  only by some of our leaders in London, who knew that they would alter it as soon as they could. And so it happened.', 'Based on the colonial system of control and repression, that early Constitution was radically changed many times over the ensuing years  not to improve it but to increase the power of the presidency and authoritarian rule. And it is this that has been at the centre of our political and economic woes.', 'As I have said, any Constitution is only as good as its implementation. And, unfortunately, we have seen this limitation in action since 2013, as the President has sought to sign into law Bills passed by the National Assembly but not debated in the Senate  in total contravention of the Constitution but typical of previous imperial presidents, who cared little about constitutions and law and order when they were defending their own interests.', 'At talks during the making of the new Constitution, Kenyans from all walks of life unanimously declared this imperial presidency the enemy of the people.', 'Raila makes a strong case, with carefully thought-out and clearly presented reasoning, for a parliamentary, rather than a presidential, system of government. He outlines why this would be a far better choice in upholding, implementing and securing the principles of good governance under our progressive Constitution.', 'His argument is compelling in persuading that this is a very serious consideration if we are ever to change the despair-ridden repetition of our countrys history.', 'Once again, his argument is not made dogmatically. He illustrates it with diverse historical examples, all of which shed greater light on the issue and put it into clear perspective.', 'This book is published just before the August 8 General Election, in which Raila is the presidential candidate for the National Super Alliance, a coalition of several political parties.', 'The books content clearly demonstrates that the candidate is focussed not merely on achieving state power but more importantly on what he and his administration should do with that power to turn Kenyas fortunes around. ', 'Raila is widely read and a deep philosophical thinker. Armed with an arsenal of knowledge from his reading and from his experience, he makes clear in his Little Orange Book the old pathways and roadblocks that Kenyans must leave behind, and the new paths they must take to achieve positive change for all.', 'Very competitively priced at Sh100, this elegantly produced and handily pocket-sized volume is a must-read for all Kenyans who care about our collective future.
