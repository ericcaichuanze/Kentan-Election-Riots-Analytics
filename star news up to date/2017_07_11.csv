Conceptualised to promote industrialisation through the establishment of factories in a specific area under a set of incentives buttressed in law to serve the export market, SEZs are expected to be a major draw for investors.', ' ', 'Once the CCCC completes the project, the SGR is expected to turn Naivasha into a magnet for SEZ investors and their tenants, who will require a reliable freight service to haul raw materials from the Mombasa port to their factories and transport the finished product to the coastal town for exportation to overseas markets. It goes without saying that the Mai Mahiu Freight Exchange Centre and the Naivasha SEZ are also likely to be major employers, during construction and when they finally start operations.', ' ', 'And as the Mombasa-Nairobi phase of the SGR has shown, the project in itself is a major generator of jobs, both during construction and actual operation. The message that needs to go out to local leaders in the host counties of Kajiado, Narok and Nakuru is that these jobs, through the contractor CCCC, will be secured based on the skill-sets of the local populations and not by inciting blind, communal agitation targetted at project instalations and staff.', ' ', 'Besides the National Exchequer, county governments also stand to benefit from higher revenue collections, spurred by increased commercial activity in their jurisdictions, especially by small and medium enterprises feeding off the SGR. Property investors, as the Mombasa-Nairobi line is actively proving, are all but assured of great value appreciation and with it, better returns on their investment.', ' ', 'Local communities can also expect to benefit from attendant amenities that would ordinarily come with such a project. These include electricity, sewerage, water and better access roads to act as feeders to the SGR line. Given the inter-nodal nature of any transport network, the SGRs socioeconomic dividend will eventually be dependent on the size of the hinterland it serves.', ' ', 'The Nairobi-Naivasha, Naivasha-Kisumu, Kisumu-Malaba and Ugandan components are thus key to stretching the SGRs catchment area into Western Kenya and Uganda. The socioeconomic prospects become especially salient when one considers the governments ongoing plans to position Kisumu into a freight transport hub for East and Central Africa.', ' ', ' The author is the Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure, Housing and Urban Development', '\n']"
