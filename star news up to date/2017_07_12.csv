I felt that a lot of talk was about fun and lifestyle, but there wasnt anyone talking about growth and progress. I began it as a strategic differentiator, then grew into a movement. It became vividly clear that Kenyan youth needed help, they needed solid advice, guidance, direction and mentorship. I have pushed on ever since, sharing the wisdom and experience I have gained over the years, using my own life and success story as an example and roping in like-minded individuals to do the same.', 'When asked how practical the initiative is for the youth, who are at a disadvantage when it comes to capital, opportunities, mentorship, etc, he said, Access to capital remains a tall order. The systems in place demand collateral or a payslip to get credit. The table banking system in funds such as Uwezo and YEDF are also major hindrances. It is not practical to get six-10 young people who think the same, who have the same goals and the same financial habits. The Deputy President even confirmed that uptake of these funds is at an all-time low. The system is simply built to cut off disadvantaged youth.', 'Speaking of the highlights from the initiative, he stated, As is evident, we have started a revolution!

The voting patterns in the 2013 presidential election results have no indication that President Uhuru Kenyattas victory could be attributed to the laptop promise. Personally, I believe the project was not a top priority in a country where the majority of secondary schools have no science laboratories.', 'Nevertheless, whenever tender fights over procurement of the laptops erupted, the media would fill up with stories about how Jubilee was failing to deliver on its key campaign promise. I am unaware of any significant public demand for laptops.', 'The way I see it is that in lobbying for inclusion of specific projects in manifestos the tenderpreneurs-cum-campaign financiers are effectively buying political insurance for their financial contributions in three key respects.', 'First, these projects have been accorded special priority status and are supposed to be implemented within tight schedules to guarantee that before the principals in a new administration learn their way in the dark world of project finance or groom their own brokers, the campaign financiers would have been paid their commissions.', 'Secondly, through the manifesto the prerogative and autonomy of the incoming Cabinet and Parliament to determine national economic agenda and allocation of resources are curtailed or compromised in advance.', 'Thirdly, the inclusion of these projects in the manifesto enables the tenderpreneurs to subsequently disguise their private schemes as the national agenda on the basis of which the government was voted into power.', 'Logically, from the standpoint of tenderpreneurs, regime change every five years is the best-case scenario because an opposition coalition is more vulnerable to their demands than the incumbent, which is likely to curry the favour of established businesses with vested interest in policy continuity.', 'Viewed this way, we should probably thank Dr David Ndii and his reformist associates in NASA for their objections to the growing influence of tenderpreneurs in their coalition.', 'From a public interest standpoint, there are three reasons why Kenyans should be sceptical about manifestos and their place in national economic planning and management.', 'First, Kenya is a poor country enjoined under Article 201 of its Constitution to use public money in a prudent and responsible way whilst ensuring openness and accountability, including public participation. Given that none of the coalition and political parties have engaged their supporters in making their manifestos, it is obvious that the preferences of party owners and principals should not be viewed as legally binding after the election.', 'In my view, after winning power the winning coalition should review its manifesto to align it with the public interest and priorities, otherwise a manifesto can easily become an instrument of corruption.', 'Secondly, Articles 95 and 96 of the Constitution vest in the National Assembly and Senate the mandate to determine, allocate and appropriate national revenue to national government, the counties and national state organs. This collective responsibility should never be subordinated to manifestos written in boardrooms and exclusive hotels.', 'Finally, the majority of the special projects in the political manifestos will have to be financed through foreign borrowing. Under Article 214 of the Constitution public debt is a charge on the Consolidated Fund. There is obvious danger that manifestobacked projects will deprive the country of resources to finance projects that may be more useful and justified.', 'Likewise such projects can easily secure sovereign immunity from prosecution for their promoters in case of any corruption because government officials would be compromised in advance to allow the tenderpreneurs to recover their political investment. Hence, there will be no political will to fight corruption relating to procurement and financing of such projects.', 'To conclude, the apparent discovery by the corruption cartels of the value of manifestos presents the spectre of fragile countries being bankrupted by corruption or auctioning their sovereignty for 30 pieces of silver.', '\n']"

"", ""The former union leader won global admiration for transformative social policies that helped reduce stinging inequality in Latin America's biggest country. "", ""The verdict represented the highest-profile conviction yet in the sweeping corruption investigation that for over three years has rattled Brazil, revealing a sprawling system of graft at top levels of business and government and throwing the country's political system into disarray. "", 'Judge Sergio Moro found Lula guilty of accepting 3.7 million reais ($1.2 million) worth of bribes from engineering firm OAS SA, the amount prosecutors said the company spent refurbishing a beach apartment for Lula in return for his help winning contracts with state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro. ', 'Federal prosecutors have accused Lula, who first took the presidency in 2003, of masterminding a long-running corruption scheme that was uncovered in a probe into kickbacks around Petrobras.

', ""If he cannot run, political analysts say Brazil's left would be thrown into disarray, forced to rebuild and somehow find a leader who can emerge from the immense shadow that Lula has cast on Brazilian politics for three decades. "", '""Lula\'s absence opens a gaping hole in the political scene, it creates an enormous power vacuum on the left,"" said Claudio Couto, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a top university.', ' ""We have now entered a situation of extreme political tension, even beyond the chaos we have been living for the last year.""', ""Couto said he expected Lula's guilty verdict to be upheld by the appeals court. That would leave the 2018 presidential race wide open and raise chances of a victory by a political outsider, given most known contenders are also ensnared in Brazil's corruption investigations."", ""Lula's two-terms were marked by a commodity boom that momentarily made Brazil one of the world's fastest-growing economies."", "" His ambitious foreign policies, aligning Brazil with other big developing nations, raised the country's profile on the global stage. "", ""With Lula's swagger setting the tone, Brazil sought to shrug off northern economic and political hegemony and engage in global problems, like Middle East peace and the standoff over Iran's nuclear program. "", 'Former US President Barack Obama once labeled him the most popular politician on earth. ', ""But upon leaving office and managing to get his hand-selected successor Dilma Rousseff elected, Brazil's economy soured, with the nation just now beginning to emerge from its worst recession on record. "", 'Rousseff was impeached last year for breaking budgetary rules. ', ""She and her backers say her ouster was actually a 'coup' orchestrated by her vice president and now President Michel Temer, who himself faces corruption charges. "", 'During his trial, Lula gave five hours of fiery and defiant defense, proclaiming his innocence and saying that it was politics and not the pilfering of public funds that put him on trial. ', '""But what is happening is not getting me down, just motivating me to go out and talk more,"" Lula said in his testimony. ""I will keep fighting."" ', '\n']"
