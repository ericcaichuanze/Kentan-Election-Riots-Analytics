However, and unknown to many, things have not been rosy. We are told that Jimmy has become a nightmare to some people in NASA.

Reason? The legislator, who lost during the Jubilee Party primaries, is during the day part of President Uhuru Kenyattas reelection team campaign caravan, but during the night he is campaigning against the Jubilee candidate who he lost to during April primaries. The lawmaker has been criss-crossing the constituency during the night, telling the voters not to vote for the young politician. Uhuru has however been informed of the politicians shenanigans and Corridors has learnt that the MPs being kicked out of the national Jubilee campaign caravan is imminent.', '===', 'A NASA honcho from Nyanza is in panic after his attempts to defraud the campaign team of some cash hit a dead-end last week. The former lawmaker, who is part of the NASA presidential campaign team, got the shock of his life after his tricks to inflate accommodation costs of the campaign team were thwarted. The politician had been asked to book hotel rooms for some of the presidential campaign secretariat team but decided to hatch a plot to get a cut of Sh200,000 by exaggerating prices. It was a shameful encounter when some officials confronted him over the dirty work in what nearly ended in a fistfight.', '===', 'So, is another batch of police officers being trained at Embakasi? Well, sources whisper to Corridors that AP and regular police officers being trained on the election are set to graduate today. A police officer was heard whispering that the poll trainees are well taken care of. For instance, they have special meals, different from the recruits training at the facility. He also claimed that his colleagues would be entitled to a huge allowance after the polls. It is unclear why the hefty allowance would be paid and by whom. A few weeks ago, opposition chief Raila Odinga claimed police officers, together with the military, were being trained to rig the election. The claims triggered a bitter exchange between Jubilee and NASA.', '\n']"

From an already troubled situation in 2012, Kenya media freedom has deteriorated markedly under the current government. The wide variety of energetic media outlets paints a patina of pluralism and vibrancy that belies pervasive obstacles to a genuinely active, open media. Fast evolving business models are challenging all media houses. More significant to news content are soft censorship exercised through official financial pressure on media houses; impunity for harassment and physical intimidation of journalists; and the ubiquitous Brown Envelope Rot that severely constrains Kenya medias capacity to honestly address the most important issues facing their country.', ' ', 'During a five-week visit to Kenya in June-July, I met with dozens of journalists and many civil society activists across five counties from Coast to Nyanza. Perspectives I gathered are admittedly anecdotal, but amply reinforced by other reporting, and deserve broader and deeper investigation. Below is a distillation of the most compelling observations, as gleaned from a range of media people, from bloggers to top editorsa few senior, and rather jaded, some young and almost alarmingly unformed.', ' ', 'Many of these matters affect and afflict not only Kenya media. Over the past two years, I have learned of similar challenges in meetings with journalists in Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, and Uganda, and further afield beyond Africa. Brown Envelope Rot (as a Malawian reporter dubbed it), intimidation, soft censorship, skewed coverage of women, poor election coverage, these all are widespread concerns; on the last, mainstream US reporting of the 2016 presidential contest is a textbook failure.', ' ', 'These reflections are framed in the Kenya context of a nominally free press, with additional reference to the current campaign season. These elections, too, will passwe ardently hope peacefullybut the need to build an active, open media that enables genuine democratic debate will persist. How that should be done is beyond the scope of this piece, and should be the subject of urgent discussion for Kenya media and civil society, in conjunction with officials genuinely committed to their countrys democratic development.', ' ', 'Ten Observations', ' ', '1. Devolved Revenue, Devolved', ' ', 'Censorship', ' ', 'Devolution of governmental authority and revenue to county level has been accompanied by a little-remarked devolution of hard and soft censorship of media outside Nairobi, including in some counties widespread bribery where most of the press corps is bought-out, and blatant physical intimidation of journalists by governors and even Members of County Assembly, and aspirants for office. Follow the money, anyone?', ' ', '2. Fakery in Cyberspace... and Elsewhere', ' ', 'Kenyas burgeoning cyberspace is facilitating much mischief in the form of fake news. Manufactured tweets and fabricated Facebook posts, to paraphrase Mark Twain, are riding the SGR while truth sits jammed at the Likoni ferry. But very few Kenya media folk are easily duped. The real problem is that many journalists, even in major media houses, can be bribed to report half-truths, and some editors require whole lies. Potemkin lead to investigative journalists: search ye a much-lauded shower, suckled by a bowser.', ' ', '3. Vernacular Polarisation', ' ', 'The growing reach of regionally based vernacular commercial radio and television across Kenya may accelerate already deep polarisation of perception of current events and Kenyas basic challenges among various ethnic groups. This, and the chasms of understanding of historical injustices among Kenyas peoples, sharply affect what people feel is real. Deeply entrenched alternative narratives are far more dangerous than fake news. These divides are sometimes sharply present in newsrooms, as well, with ethno-political pre-conceptions and biases sometimes over-riding factual reporting.', ' ', '4. Brown Envelope Rot', ' ', 'Envelopmental Journalism is the norm across most Kenya media, from salaried staff reporters to poorly-compensated county correspondents [largely free-lancers who are paid little more than Sh500-1,000 for an article]. Paid-for press prevails not only because almost all sectors of Kenya society consider corruption as entirely normal; journalists, particularly the free-lance correspondents, are so ill-paid that, day-to-day, being biddable is tantamount to financial survival. Think unga.Consider school fees. Ponder sugar.... Kenya media people are highly vulnerable and often pliable to financial inducementsfrom officials, from business, from civil societyeven as some reporters describe how painful it is not to operate as the professional journalists they thought they would be.', ' ', 'This Brown Envelope Rot reaches taints editorial levels in newsrooms of major media houses, where reporters find stories unfavourable to certain governors and other politicians routinely spiked, and where journalists believe they are spied on not only by the NIS, but by bought-out colleagues.', ' ', '5. No-go Stories', ' ', 'A number of issues cannot be covered in meaningful fashion, unless and until they almost literally explode in a very public fashion. No-go stories include anything that might too much discomfit the High&Mighty: top-level corruption; narco-trafficking; land-grabbing; extrajudicial killings [call it murder] from Kwale to Lamu. And Coast journalists also report threats from extremists who menace them and their families.', ' ', '6. Homage to Titans', ' ', 'Some of these worst qualities described above converged this July in an orgiastic outpouring of media homage (especially on television) to political titans who passed from this world. The almost totally hagiographic hullabaloo following Nicholas Biwotts death was surely the lapdog nadir. In a 2006 piece describing Biwott as Kenyas comeback king, the BBC offered: True or not, Mr. Biwott has continued to be seen by many Kenyans as a symbol of the darkest days of former President Mois rule. Yet nearly all was now bathed in purest light of laundered hindsight, unless one plumbed corners of the internet offering an alternative eulogy. Are there any readers who would have accepted a tour of Nyayo House from the man back in the day? Journalism serving as the first rough draft of history has here already been well hashed into sausage to assuage even the departed High&Mighty.', ' ', '7. Reporting on Women/Women Reporters', ' ', 'Coverage of women in Kenya politics is often skewed and sometimes overtly sexist, unless one holds this is appropriate in a traditionally conservative and patriarchal society. Indeed, many reporters [female and male] say it is often hard to get women to offer opinions, especially for publication. Within the media sphere, women reporters describe almost unceasing sexual harassment and even physical abuse by colleagues and from people they seek to report on; many male journalists dismiss such despicable behavior as part of the game.', ' ', '8. Civil Society: Allies and/or Corruptors', ' ', 'Kenyas media and civil society are natural allies who need to learn to work better together. CSOs complain that media practitioners expect the same sort of bribes [sorry, brown envelopes] to cover social justice efforts as are supplied by businesses and politicos.... and too many CSOs are willing to join the game. Journalists rightly view much CSO news as PR puffery aimed to impress donors. CSOs must supply media credible news they can use, and introduce reporters to relatable stories of real people that will engage broad audiences and promote much-needed social and environmental awareness and change.', ' ', '9. The Election Season', ' ', 'In this campaign season, issues described above are often exacerbated by the zero-sum competition of Kenya elections. The emphasis on the personality driven horse-race coverage and fascination with sometimes flawed and even meaningless polls are common in many countries. Parties positions on issues and how they might affect real people receive even scanter coverage than usual. Intensified bribery or intimidation of media to assure positive coverage is a persistent part of the campaign playbook to gain office as a gateway to great spoils. Political candidates, even on the local level, invest immense sums to win offices whose salary could never recoup such costs. Scandals of the High&Mighty, even when exposed to an intrepid reporter [and rarely in any major media outlet], sink even more quickly than usual from public scrutiny.', ' ', 'Women candidates often receive less favourable coverage, facing questions of home life and financing never asked of men. And partisan vernacular coverage that predictably leans towards one party only will widen the gulf of intolerance that threatens another post-election conflagration.', ' ', ' 10. And Yet... Excellence, Sometimes Sighted', ' ', 'There is still excellent and insightful journalism performed in Kenya. Important issues that dont touch the most powerful can be addressed with vigour that promotes change, such as providing sanitary napkins for schoolgirls. Many Kenyan scribes would delight in being the crusading watchdogs they dreamed of during their studies, or perhaps as young people growing up to the unwaveringly authoritative tones of the BBC in a remote rural home. A few media people still take great risks to expose malfeasance of the High&Mightyeven if such investigative work now rarely reaches mainstream media. Some committed reporters today work with media-savvy CSOs that help them explore and explain the plight of real people, producing high-quality reporting on the most urgent social issues of the dayand need not be bribed to do so. Some media outlets offer models and means for tolerance.', ' ', ' The Watchdog and Kenyas Caravan of Corruption', ' ', 'But journalism in Kenya is described as a younger persons game. Not just because supporting a family on a reporters salary is testing for most honest media folk. The profession, I heard too often, is profoundly morally sapping. Even the finest and fiercest watchdog reporting, even when not spiked, even when drawing pointed retribution, has for far too long evoked scant change. The High&Mighty can quite simply ignore it, confident that they are beyond any earthly jurisdiction. The Weston Hotel cholera case in Nairobi is a very recent example, the ICC another.', ' ', 'Even the equatorial sunlight is robbed of its disinfectant qualities.

It can improve brain development and mothers are encouraged to exclusively breastfeed their babies for the first six months of their infants lives.', 'But breastfeeding is not just a one-woman job. Women require support from family, healthcare providers, employers and policymakers to make the six months target attainable.', 'World Breastfeeding Week 2017', 'Sustaining Breastfeeding Together  that is this years theme for the World Breastfeeding Week which runs from August 1 to August 7 every year.', 'As mothers and stakeholders come together to discuss the progress in attaining the WHO recommended six months of exclusive breastfeeding, Kenya has not been left behind.

The Bill proposes that employers give mothers with infants regular breaks lasting not more than 40 minutes every four hours.

', 'Kenya Association of Breastfeeding', 'KAB was launched on July 29. It was founded by a group of certified breastfeeding counsellors and lactation educators. The associations motto is Breastfeeding takes a village.', 'The Star spoke to KAB co-founder Josephine Karoki and Career Mothers for Exclusive Breastfeeding director Martha Kimkung on the developments towards achieving the six months breastfeeding target.', 'New mothers struggles', 'Many mothers lack sufficient emotional, mental and physical support during the first six months postpartum, but the issues are magnified for working mothers because there is almost no support available in most workplaces.', 'Kimkung says a breastfeeding mother who also works needs a supportive employer who is also invested in her goal to exclusively breastfeed her baby for the first six months.', 'This can only be achieved if mothers are given the time and facilities to express milk, store it and get it to her child in good time. ', 'Kimkung says, It would be better if a mother can physically breastfeed her baby by either bringing the child to work, working part time or working from home after the three months maternity leave has expired.', 'Organisations with best practices', 'Few organisations in Kenya support breastfeeding mothers. According to the Kenya Private Sector Alliance, some of the companies with best practices include Safaricom, Kenya Women Microfinance Bank, Nestle and Mabati Rolling Mills. Other organisations include the International Medical Corps, the Kenya Red Cross, World Vision, ICRAF and the World Bank.', 'Some of the best practices include allowing women to combine the 90 days statutory maternity leave with their annual leave, the option of flexible working arrangements - reporting to work later and leaving early, the provision to work half day after maternity leave, designated breastfeeding rooms with pumping and milk storage facilities and the setting up of childrens creches.', 'Karoki says, It is difficult for working mothers to strike a balance between being available to their children and excelling in their careers, and more often than not, one aspect will suffer. Some women choose less demanding careers after having children while others choose to create a strong support system of caregivers at home that allows them to focus on their careers.', 'Concerning the Breastfeeding Mothers Bill, Karoki is cautious about celebrating it being passed. She says, Breastfeeding bills are usually passed in Parliament, but are never assented to by the President. These bills continuously coming back into Parliament shows there is a need to improve the health of infants in Kenya. Breastfeeding is the optimal way of feeding an infant for the first six months of life. We need to ensure we bring up a healthy next generation.', 'Karoki continues, Women were given the exclusive and unique position to be mothers and nurses of the next generation of workers  male and female  by God and nature. They, therefore, should not be discriminated against because of the motherhood factor or just because men do not have the awesome privilege of bearing and nursing children. The uniqueness of motherhood should be acknowledged and not frowned upon. Motherhood should not be looked at as a disadvantage, but rather should be celebrated and protected. ', 'Kimkung says it is unfair to make women choose between motherhood and their careers. ', 'Myriad of challenges', 'Time and space to breastfeed in the workplace is not the only challenge nursing mothers face that make them abandon breastfeeding early. Cracked nipples, pain and discomfort as the baby learns to latch on and engorgement are some of the other issues that have made some mothers abandon breastfeeding early. ', 'Samantha Wayua, a mother of one, says, Every time my son tried to grab my nipple, I felt so much pain I wanted to cry and push him away. So many times I wanted to give up on the breastfeeding, but it got better with time. I know many friends who didnt have the patience to stick it out.', 'Karoki says there is a lack of cohesion between stakeholders and influencers. ', 'The information given to an expectant mother regarding breastfeeding will most likely come from her peers or the internet and this information may not be correct or supported by facts. Therefore, even before the mother has begun her breastfeeding journey, she has already formed biases, and makes decisions based on this, she says.', 'Not many healthcare professionals have specific training in lactation and how to support breastfeeding mothers, so if a mother experiences difficulties during the first few days postpartum, she may not get adequate support from doctors. ', 'This is the information and support gap that breastfeeding counsellors and lactation educators are trained to fill by offering prenatal breastfeeding and postpartum support, Karoki says. Karoki is a certified lactation educator.', 'Kenya not doing badly', 'Despite the challenges, Kenya has seen a remarkable growth in exclusive breastfeeding for children under six months old. In 2003, only 13 per cent of mothers were breastfeeding exclusively. In 2014, the figure shot up to 61 per cent, according to the Kenya Demographic Health Survey. ', 'There is a push by WHO to encourage governments to ensure more mothers exclusively breastfeed for six months.', 'Side bar', 'How to make the breastfeeding experience better', 'Adapted from mayoclinic.org', '1. Ask for help right away', 'Reading about breast-feeding is one thing. Doing it on your own is something else. The first time you breast-feed your baby  preferably within the first hour after delivery  ask for help.', '2. Let your baby set the pace', 'For the first few weeks, most newborns breastfeed every two to three hours round-the-clock. Watch for early signs of hunger, such as stirring, restlessness, sucking motions and lip movements.', ""Let your baby nurse from the first breast thoroughly, until your breast feels soft  typically about 15 to 20 minutes. Keep in mind, however, that there is no set time. Then try burping the baby. After that, offer the second breast. If your baby's still hungry, he or she will latch on. If not, simply start the next breast-feeding session with the second breast. If your baby consistently nurses on only one breast at a feeding during the first few weeks, pump the other breast to relieve pressure and protect your milk supply."", '3. Gauge your success', ""When your baby is latched on successfully, you'll feel a gentle pulling sensation on your breast  rather than a pinching or biting sensation on your nipple. Your breasts might feel firm or full before the feeding, and softer or emptier afterward. "", '4. Take care of your nipples', ""After each feeding, it's fine to let the milk dry naturally on your nipple. The milk can soothe your nipples. If you're in a hurry, gently pat your nipple dry. If your breasts leak between feedings, use bra pads  and change them often."", 'When you bathe, minimize the amount of soap, shampoo and other cleansers that might contact your nipples. If your nipples are dry or cracked, use purified lanolin after each feeding. This can soothe cracked nipples, as well as help your nipples retain moisture.', '5. Make healthy lifestyle choices', ""Your lifestyle choices are just as important when you're breastfeeding as they were when you were pregnant. For example:"", 'Eat a healthy diet ', ' Drink plenty of fluids', ' Rest as much as possible', "" Don't smoke"", ' Be cautious with medication', '6.

You should be. The tens of millions of Kenyans who depend on Public Health facilities are too. I'm too."", '\n', 'Ironically, even those who can and should take action and make a difference for our country are equally angry, frustrated and disappointed.', '\n', 'The point is that we all are feeling the same and that means it is not what will break the impasse.', '\n', '\n', 'For 95 days, the Kenyan Doctors have been on a struggle to restore their dignity and determine their destiny.', '\n', 'That struggle has been long and painful.For 95 days, the public hospitals have been minimally or not functional at all.', '\n', 'That was not our wish or objective from the start and the public have grown weary and stretched by the unending stalemate that has been the issue of CBA registration and implementation.', '\n', 'While for the Kenyan doctors it was and has remained purely an industrial dispute between an employer and a group of employees, the strike meant other things and has thus been deliberately mishandled as a punishment for the doctors.', '\n', 'For KMPDU, the strike was never a contest of any sorts. This was simply a struggle to influence public policy relating to how WE the Kenyan doctors engage our employer, the Government, and how our Healthcare can be made to respond to each of our needs as citizens first and then as Doctors second.', '\n', 'We believed that Doctors United can change healthcare for everybody and bring back the nobility of a profession that is on the brink of collapse. It was about patriotism for our country.', '\n', 'For 95 days, the society has revealed itself to doctors in ways we all never imagined. And if there is one unforgettable outcome of the strike is that we now know what each and everybody in society thinks about doctors.', '\n', 'And we also know how such opinion have affected our profession. And the subtle corporate influence in matters public policy in Healthcare. It is in deed the reason we were in the struggle in the first place.', '\n', 'There has been little doubt that our profession is at threat at the expense of political expediency. And Beyond our immediate need to have our CBA or the union protected, there is urgent need to protect the medical profession.', '\n', 'For 95 days we have been injured in our hearts. By insults and ridicules. We shall heal. We forgive. We have been sacked ad infinitum and we have been character assassinated.', '\n', 'We have been emotionally abused by use of our moral and ethical obligation to the Hippocratic Oath. We have remained strong and United. We have demonstrated resolve beyond understanding to many.', '\n', 'From the start, there was already a plan to make the doctor tire. To push the doctor to his unbearable limits and finally deal a death blow to the union and the medical profession.', '\n', 'We approached negotiations with utmost good faith and obedience. Responding to every call of meeting and staying late sometimes up to 3am even after you advised us to keep it only up to 5pm.', '\n', 'Because we believed we could quickly come to an agreement and restore industrial harmony. But there were other plans that we should either have a very bad deal or have nothing at all.', '\n', 'And there in lies what has kept the strike for 95 days. When we kept talking about the CBA, the Government kept talking about offers and portraying the strike as simply a greedy quest for more money.', '\n', 'We did eventually talked and concluded the CBA. Yesterday, having consulted NAC, we decided that the financial offer be put in the CBA which then should be signed and registered.', '\n', 'And as fate would prove, the goalposts have shifted once again. The same CBA we revised for months should now wait another 30 days for signing and registration thereafter. The fact is no one wants you to have a CBA. Because a CBA is to a union what the constitution is to a country.', '\n', 'When we are at the very near end, a hurdle is being introduced. Doctors we have done our bit and our bit has been the best.', '\n', 'Congratulations. Let us be angry and frustrated and disappointed. Let us even cry but let us do it for our country and for the millions of citizens who pass through our hands daily in such of health. Let us do it healthcare. Let us not weep for long because as sure as the sun shall arise, we can only move forward.', '\n', 'No one should never convince you that fighting for what is right is not worth it. No one deserves your anger beyond the need to protect your profession. Be sure, we shall overcome.', '\n', 'But the success of the union depends on the very resolve and the unity we exhibit. Let us guard it. While all doctors have been ready to resume duty, doing so under threats, intimidation and show of disrespect is tantamount to career suicide. Avoid until when we advice so.', '\n', 'Finally, it is important to note that while the payroll and the hospital belongs to the government, your skill is selfishly yours. Use it to serve humanity in the best way possible.', '\n', 'But let not you think that it must be forced on you to use it. Your skill as a doctor is what you provide as Labour. How much is it worth? Some dignity perhaps. Some respect certainly!', '\n', 'We await to conclude the signing of Recognition Agreements, CBA and then after RTWF as was guided by the Court of Appeal under the Mediation of Religious Leaders. We hope this shall be done soon.', '\n', 'Thank you. God bless you. Keep Calm.', '\n', ' ', '\n']"

It might sound simplistic to suggest that his hopes of winning the August 8 election have been irreparably ruined, but it is increasingly looking like the odds are now stuck against him.', 'The founder of the Chama Cha Mashinani has suggested he hopes to bring 1.5 million votes across Rift Valley to NASA, although his detractors say he will not muster a few thousand votes for the opposition, perhaps a few hundred.', 'SHOCK DEFECTION', 'Ruttos decision to join NASA with his CCM party came as a shocker, although he had always maintained a soft spot for the opposition, especially former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.', 'Some of the governors supporters told me this week that there were not sure whether they would continue to support him. Others said they would not vote for him after the move.', 'Others, however, defended the decision on local language radio stations, saying the Jubilee government has mistreated the county chief and it was appropriate for him to change camps.', 'The hue and cry I am hearing from supports and distractors... that Ruttos switch to NASA is detrimental to his career is misplaced, an aide to the governor commented.', 'There have been several social media posts from users suggesting that the move had made it easy for residents to vote for Jubilee in August.', 'IRRECONCONCILIABLE DIFFERENCES', 'Governor Ruttos journey out of URP  an outfit that sponsored him in 2013  started soon after the poll.', 'Initial differences started with accusations by DPs supporters that the governor was undermining URP, by meeting Kanu officials.', 'The row escalated into a power struggle, with the governor accusing the DP of political intolerance and abusing elected leaders.', 'The DP is a roaming dictator Kenyans should take note of, Rutto was quoted in early 2015. In reaction, an aide of the DP dismissed the governor as a village elder, who suffers from attention disorder. Later, Rutto said the Deputy President was undermining counties. Somehow, the message resonated with residents and at one point, it was felt that the agenda was succeeding, even threatening DP Rutos popularity across the Rift Valley.', 'The campaign for more resources lost steam after recent audits indicated massive corruption had marred the performance of the devolved units. It was clear that the differences between the two were irreconcilable when the Bomet chief formed CCM.', 'With neither side willing to compromise, there was no future working relationship. ', 'AUGUST ELECTIONS', 'But joining the opposition NASA was still an unusual move for Governor Rutto. A recent poll said more than 70 per cent of the residents supported Jubilee. It was largely expected that Rutto would support President Uhuru Kenyatta but contest for reelection on his CCM ticket. Such a plan was going to extremely complicate Jubilees strategy in the governor race, and possibly give the incumbent very strong chances.', 'After nomination polls close and nominees passed on to electoral commission, it is expected that the DP will arrive in Bomet county to put to the people the options they have ahead of the polls  to remain in government or join the opposition.', 'Rutos 2022 presidential bid will become a rallying call for the Kalenjin community to remain in Jubilee.', 'While campaigning to rally the Kipsigis to support Jubilee, DP Rutos national campaign message  that the opposition is disillusioned and directionless  will come in handy.', 'Such a message will be a major boost for Jubilee candidates. The biggest winner will be the governor candidate, whose chances in this election will be significantly boosted. Sotik MP and National Assembly Deputy Speaker Joyce Laboso remains the favourite to win the Jubilee nomination, according to a recent poll.', 'If she will be the candidate, then recent campaign attacks from Ruttos supporters against her would have been effectively silenced. She has been targetted as undeserving of the seat because of her marriage to a Luo.', 'By joining up with Raila, a Luo, Ruttos supporters would struggle to justify misogynistic attacks against Laboso.', 'Meanwhile, CCM candidates, and to some level independent candidates, will be the main losers in Ruttos political move. It is doubtful any CCM candidate will be elected in the South Rift, where the party will be sponsoring candidates.', 'Some CCM candidates were hoping to win seats by campaigning for Jubilee and President Uhurus reelection. But now, the Jubilee machine will amplify the political schism and simplify that the race would be between the opposition and the government.', 'Suggestions that in joining NASA, Rutto is seeking a place remain relevant in national politics after losing the August elections, are a bit farfetched.', 'DP RUTO GAME PLAN', 'The defection has given the DP Ruto better prospects of sending his political nemesis into political obscurity.', 'For the DP, getting his namesake defeated in the election is absolutely crucial to his 2022 presidential bid.', 'Rutto has been a thorn on the backside of the Deputy President  a former close ally who, with him, received political orientation in the dying years of President Daniel Mois years in power. Ruto hopes to rally his home constituency in the Rift Valley to provide core support as he tries his hand in the 2002 presidential race. Unity at home will be key in this journey.', 'Besides the home support, the thinking within DPs camp is that he will court political orphans left behind by NASA, assuming they lose in August.', 'RAILA HARD SELL', 'No one really can say if there is any tangible thing that Rutto will be offering NASA. He told Citizen TV on Wednesday night that brings forth fresh perspective: Perhaps nothing more. If Raila is nominated as NASA flagbearer, Rutto will struggle hard to sell the historic candidate.', 'I have written in the past that Raila lost the Kalenjin Rift Valley constituency after the 2007 poll. Two issues, among others, contributed to the loss of the region  Mau Forest evictions and his comments that the 2007-08 violence was planned.', 'A campaign for the opposition is likely to revive the disappointment that greeted the Kalenjin, who to a man supported Raila in 2007, only to later feel sidelined when he became Prime Minister.', 'It is easy to stir distress over Raila by mentioning the International Criminal Court, where two Kalenjins  DP Ruto and Joshua arap Sang  alongside Uhuru were prosecuted before their cases were dropped. ', 'While the former Prime Minister generally said his party did not plan the violence, some people believe he did not speak up loud enough in support of Ruto and Sang. When he spoke, his message was cacophonic. And when it was clear, it seemed to support the ICC narrative that the violence was planned.', 'Having indicated that he does not intend to be considered a NASA presidential candidate, Ruttos decision to formally join the opposition will heighten the fight for the hearts and votes in the Rift Valley.', '\n']"
