It was the first of two tragedies to hit the young Nairobi pastor in quick succession. But she is a survivor.', '\n', 'It was going to be a very big wedding. I was a pastor, so all our church members were coming, as well as all our relatives. My fiance, Harry, and I were very excited  we were getting married in All Saints Cathedral in Nairobi, and I had rented a beautiful dress.', '\n', 'But the night before the wedding, I realised that I had some of Harrys clothes, including his cravat. He couldnt show up without a tie, so a friend who had stayed the night offered to take it to him first thing in the morning. We got up at dawn and I walked her to the bus station.', '\n', 'As I was making my way back home, I walked past a guy sitting on the bonnet of a car. Suddenly he grabbed me from behind and dumped me in the back seat. There were two more men inside, and they drove off. It all happened in a fraction of a second.', '\n', 'A piece of cloth was stuffed in my mouth. I was kicking and hitting out and trying to scream. When I managed to push the gag out, I screamed: Its my wedding day! That was when I got the first blow. One of the men told me to co-operate or you will die.', '\n', 'The men took turns to rape me. I felt sure I was going to die, but I was still fighting for my life, so when one of the men took the gag out of my mouth I bit his manhood. He screamed in pain and one of them stabbed me in the stomach. Then they opened the door and threw me out of the moving car.', '\n', 'I was miles from home, outside Nairobi. More than six hours had passed since I had been abducted.', '\n', 'A child saw me being thrown out and called her grandmother. People came running. When the police came they tried to get a pulse, but no-one could. Thinking I was dead, they wrapped me in a blanket and started to take me to the mortuary. But on the way there, I choked on the blanket and coughed. The policeman said: Shes alive? And he turned the car around and drove me to the biggest government hospital in Kenya.', '\n', 'I arrived in great shock, murmuring incoherently. I was half-naked and covered in blood, and my face was swollen from being punched. But something must have alerted the matron, because she guessed I was a bride. Lets go around the churches to see if theyre missing a bride, she told the nurses.', '\n', 'By coincidence, the first church they called at was All Saints Cathedral. Are you missing a bride? the nurse asked.', '\n', 'The minister said: Yes, there was a wedding at 10 oclock and she didnt come.', '\n', 'When I didnt show up to the church, my parents were panicking. People were sent out to search for me. Rumours flew. Some wondered: Did she change her mind? Others said: No, its so unlike her, what happened?', '\n', 'After a few hours, they had to take down the decorations to make room for the next ceremony. Harry had been put in the vestry to wait.', '\n', 'When they heard where I was, my parents came to the hospital with the whole entourage. Harry was actually carrying my wedding gown. But the media had also got wind of the story so there were reporters too.', '\n', 'I was moved to another hospital where Id have more privacy. That was where the doctors stitched me up and gave me some devastating news: The stab wound went deep into your womb, so you wont be able to carry any children.', '\n', 'Harry kept saying he still wanted to marry me. I want to take care of her and make sure she comes back to good health in my arms, in our house, he said. Truth be told, I wasnt in a position to say Yes or No because my mind was so jammed with the faces of the three men, and with everything that had happened.', '\n', 'A few days later, when I was less sedated, I was able to look him in the eye. I kept saying sorry. I felt like I had let him down. Some people said it was my own fault for leaving the house in the morning. It was really hurtful, but my family and Harry supported me.', '\n', 'The police never caught the rapists. I went to line-up after line-up but I didnt recognise any of the men, and it hurt me each time I went. It set back my recovery - it was 10 steps forward, 20 back. In the end I went back to the police station and said: You know what, Im done. I just want to leave it.', '\n', 'Three months after the attack I was told I was HIV-negative and got really excited, but they told me I had to wait three more months to be sure. Still, Harry and I began to plan our second wedding.', '\n', 'Although I had been very angry at the press intrusion, somebody read my story and asked to meet me. Her name was Vip Ogolla, and she was also a rape survivor. We spoke, and she told me she and her friends wanted to give me a free wedding. Go wild, have whatever you want, she said.', '\n', 'I was ecstatic. I went for a different type of cake, much more expensive. Instead of a rented gown, now I could have one that was totally mine.', '\n', 'In July 2005, seven months after our first planned wedding, Harry and I got married and went on a honeymoon.', '\n', 'Twenty-nine days later, we were at home on a very cold night. Harry lit a charcoal burner and took it to the bedroom. After dinner, he removed it because the room was really warm. I got under the covers as he locked up the house. When he came to bed he said he was feeling dizzy, but we thought nothing of it.', '\n', 'It was so cold we couldnt sleep, so I suggested getting another duvet. But Harry said he couldnt get it as he didnt have enough strength. Strangely, I couldnt stand up either. We realised something was very wrong. He passed out. I passed out. I remember coming to. I would call him. At times he would respond, at other times he wouldnt. I pushed myself out of bed and threw up, which gave me some strength. I started crawling to the phone. I called my neighbour and said: Something is wrong, Harry is not responding.', '\n', 'She came over immediately but it took me ages to crawl to the front door to let her in as I kept passing out. I saw an avalanche of people coming in, screaming. And I passed out again.', '\n', 'I woke up in hospital and asked where my husband was. They said they were working on him in the next room. I said: Im a pastor, Ive seen quite a lot in my life, I need you to be very straight with me. ', '\n', 'The doctor looked at me and said: Im sorry, your husband did not make it.', '\n', 'I couldnt believe it.', '\n', 'Going back to church for the funeral was terrible. Just a month earlier I had been there in my white dress, with Harry standing at the front looking handsome in his suit. Now, I was in black and he was being wheeled in, in a casket.', '\n', 'People thought I was cursed and held back their children from me. Theres a bad omen hanging over her, they said. At one point, I actually believed it myself.', '\n', 'Others accused me of killing my husband. That really got me down - I was grieving.', '\n', 'The post-mortem showed what really happened: as the carbon monoxide filled his system, he started choking and suffocated.', '\n', 'I had a terrible breakdown. I felt let down by God, I felt let down by everybody. I couldnt believe that people could be laughing, going out and just going about life. I crashed.', '\n', 'One day I was sitting on the balcony looking at the birds chirping away and I said: God, how can you take care of the birds and not me? In that instant I remembered there are 24 hours a day - sitting in depression with your curtains closed, no-ones going to give you back those 24 hours. Before you know, its a week, a month, a year wasted away. That was a tough reality.', '\n', 'I told everybody I would never ever get married again. God took my husband, and the thought of ever going through such a loss again was too much. Its something I wouldnt wish on anybody. The pain is so intense, you feel it in your nails.', '\n', 'But there was one man - Tonny Gobanga  who kept visiting. He would encourage me to talk about my husband and think about the good times. One time he didnt call for three days and I was so angry. Thats when it hit me that I had fallen for him.', '\n', 'Tonny proposed marriage but I told him to buy a magazine, read my story and tell me if he still loved me. He came back and said he still wanted to marry me.', '\n', 'But I said: Listen, theres another thing - I cant have children, so I cannot get married to you.', '\n', 'Children are a gift from God, he said. If we get them, Amen. If not, I will have more time to love you.', '\n', 'I thought: Wow, what a line! So I said Yes.', '\n', 'Tonny went home to tell his parents, who were very excited, until they heard my story. You cant marry her - she is cursed, they said. My father-in-law refused to attend the wedding, but we went ahead anyway. We had 800 guests  many came out of curiosity.', '\n', 'It was three years after my first wedding, and I was very scared. When we were exchanging vows, I thought: Here I am again Father, please dont let him die. As the congregation prayed for us I cried uncontrollably.', '\n', 'A year into our marriage, I felt unwell and went to the doctor - and to my great surprise he told me that I was pregnant.', '\n', 'As the months progressed I was put on total bed rest, because of the stab wound to my womb. But all went well, and we had a baby girl who we called Tehille. Four years later, we had another baby girl named Towdah.', '\n', 'Today, I am the best of friends with my father-in-law.', '\n', '\n', 'I have forgiven my attackers. It wasnt easy but I realised I was getting a raw deal by being upset with people who probably dont care. My faith also encourages me to forgive and not repay evil with evil but with good.', '\n', 'The most important thing is to mourn. Go through every step of it. Get upset until you are willing to do something about your situation. You have to keep moving, crawl if you have to. But move towards your destiny because its waiting, and you have to go and get it.', '\n']"

If the data cannot be broken down into even simple categories like men and women, old and young, racial groups, then people get overlooked or left behind in development parlance. That is the primary motivation behind Ghanas introduction of measures to capture real-time data on its citizens needs, starting with gathering better quality and more frequent data on the number and characteristics of our citizens, to enable us to better meet their needs. ', ' We are introducing a National Identification Programme, which will capture and record the most significant events in Ghanaians lives while enabling better public services simultaneously. We have also taken the important decision to make birth registration a prerequisite for obtaining a National Identification Card, and so we expect to register millions of additional children and adults in the coming months. Significant life events will be captured via the system and this new trove of data will be used to provide better public services to Ghanaians and will also be a rich source of data for statistical purposes. ', 'Current estimates are that about 40 per cent of Ghanas births go unregistered, severely limiting their life chances including opportunities to access education, healthcare, formal work or a passport to travel. A number of Ghanaians are born and depart the earth without there ever being a record of their existence. Many people dont know how old they are. With proper identification, access to and provision of vital services will become much easier. By capturing more and better information on the lived realities of women and men, boys and girls, parents and children, we can root out inequalities and begin to address structural imbalances that undermine progress in Ghana. ', 'We in Ghana have decided that one of the major problems in terms of development, has been the largely informal nature of our economy. To modernise the economy, we need to formalise the economy. In addition to our National ID system, we are adopting some radical techniques to enhance our understanding of the economy. Ghana is exploring use of anonymised telco data for mapping and planning for internal economic migration and access to social services. We are working with the UK Office for National Statistics and DfID to strengthen strategic leadership and data science capacity in our National Statistical Office in collaboration with several other countries in the region.

When we assembled a comprehensive address system in just one district, the local government saw their tax income rise by over 400 per cent in just one year. Think what this can do for government as a whole, and our ability to provide the services that our people desperately need. These measures are far in advance of many developed nations and demonstrate our ambition to harness data and technology for social good.', 'That, for me, is the spirit of the data revolution in Africa. To determine solutions based on our continents unique circumstances, solutions that are forward-looking and prepare us for the world of tomorrow are needed. We should formalise our economies without falling back on economic or technological infrastructure that has become outdated. All of this is consistent with eliminating poverty and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The past is the past. However, our forward-looking approach will provide data that not only tells us what has happened before, but also helps us shape the future. ', 'Vice President of Ghana', '\n']"
