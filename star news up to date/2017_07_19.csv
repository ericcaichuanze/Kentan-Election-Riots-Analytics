This is worrying.', 'Electoral violence is not an event in itself but usually a result of structural and institutional push factors that are often aggravated by incumbent regimes through omission and commission. If the party primaries and intolerance we saw recently are anything to go by, then the country should be prepared for an aftermath worse than what has been witnessed before.', 'The Kenyan political architecture of winner-takes-all and literally eats meat as others salivate has not helped. Political violence is not any different from terrorism, and there is no shortage of actions that are clearly preparing the country for a contested presidential outcome.', 'Political violence and extremism are not phenomena confined to Kenya or to Africa by extension. The Australian government defines it as a willingness to use violence or support the use of violence by others to promote a political ideology or religious goal. ', 'Consequently, political violence can be seen as a recourse when all else seems to be against what the people perceive as just. Some defence submissions through lawyers during the tail-end proceedings of the Kenyan cases at the International Criminal Court held that political violence could have been sparked by impunity and mistrust of institutions and was not necessarily planned. If the argument that the 2007-08 violence haphazardly sparked without any formal planning holds water, then the same could be awaiting the country come August this year if the institutions charged with electoral management do not live up to the task devoid of political manoeuvres.', 'Most scary is the involvement of top presidential contenders in reckless statements during this period. Incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta is out of order making a declaration that he will relinquish power should he lose. The Constitution explicitly spells out the succession process, and any presumption to the contrary is only farcical. Piling pressure on other presidential contenders to proclaim that they will accept defeat only fuels the suspicions that the government could be keen on an unfair process.', 'The implausible inspection of the voter register by a firm, whose experience in such is unknown and a non-participatory ballot printing tender award has not helped things either. When the electoral management agency seems reluctant to create public participation and feedback mechanisms, and only responds to political statements, while advocating patience from the public, then clearly the gods are unsettled and we have every reason to be anxious. ', 'It is insensitive to imagine that an environment satiated with socioeconomic marginalisation, poor governance, corruption, palpable looting of public resources and human rights abuses iced in police brutality can be short of participants in violent extremism. The food emergency and youth unemployment have not helped and no one would envy incumbency in this state of affairs. It is, therefore, understandable when the top leadership overreacts once in a while, when citizens do not seem to acknowledge one or two achievements here and there.', 'As Albert Einstein rightly predicated, peace is not merely absence of war but the presence of justice, of law, of order  that is government. As the Election Day approaches, it is not late for the political players and relevant institutions, including the IEBC and the judiciary, to start doing things right.', 'Political rallies that do not contribute to peace through perceived and real objectivity will bears no fruits. Disheartening is the lacklustre attitude religious institutions and civil society have about pushing for a credible electoral process. The international community, through the European Union Observation Mission, has rightly pointed to possibilities of a sham election, and this cannot be helpful. The Interior ministry keeps on boasting of its preparedness to deal with any violence, and this only confirms governments clemency for electoral fraud, and that the people must not question the outcome. ', 'A persuasion driven by intimidation to cleanse a plan towards a botched process cannot be allowed in the name of preaching peace. ', 'Also, inauspicious is the reality that under these circumstances, the government still has a constitutional mandate to protect peoples lives and property, and coordinate all agencies to ensure a credible election. The government bears the greatest responsibility for a credible and peaceful election. It is a requisite that a sitting president not only focuses on his reelection but also adheres to the Constitution that he swore to abide by and protect. This is a tough call, especially in Africa, where power and economic survival are inseparable, and probably a question that Kenyans need to deal with at some point. ', 'The implementation of Chapter 6 of the Constitution that articulates leadership and integrity has not been effectively managed by agencies concerned and this only aggravates the situation. Considering the dominance and economic opportunities that the presidency presents, maybe it is time Kenyans thought of providing for a transition period where a sitting president still considering reelection relinquishes power and an objective body takes over for a specified period. This could reduce rampant political interference with independent institutions that manage elections.', 'It is comprehensible that these independent institutions are only independent when there is political will. History confirms that electoral management agencies in this country hardly resist any overtures to subvert the will of the people. The drafters of our Constitution must have assumed that everyone ascending to the top office would be sensitive to the letter and the spirit of the supreme law, and that wisdom would prevail. A fallacy. With the antecedents, we wonder at what became of the presidency as the symbol of national unity.', '\n']"

Policing, as the art of exercising powers and functions of a police officer, within the confines of the constitution and subsequent laws, has been unmasked. What was expected of the vetting by the National Police Service Commission (NPSC) has been rendered futile. What has been called national transformation by the National Police Service (NPS) has been rendered obsolete. Ditto to the four-part series by John Allan-Namu, Inspector Fisi (Hyena).', ' ', 'As expected from the National Police spokesperson [Charles Owino], his was a defence mechanism, where the society is blamed for the ills that bedevil the police service. That is escapist, to say the least. Second, regardless of what was aired, the police have always said that these are only a few rotten apples within the service. Far from it, this is the epitome of impunity.', ' ', 'Defining Crime', ' ', 'Crime, if one were to draft a theory or formula for the same, is: CRIME = OPPORTUNITY + IMPUNITY. Which, therefore, means, the crime of bribery or fraud thrives where there is an opportunity to utilise the office you hold (read, abuse the office), and with a sure guarantee that your sins are protected by what has been termed as freedom from punishment.', ' ', 'From the foregoing, crime happens within even disciplined forces, which, therefore, translated to the opportunity for Kenyans to create two key institutions. The first was for the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), and the second is the National Police Service Commission (NPSC). These two deal with crimes of fraud, such as bribery, which the EACC deals with, or issues of indiscipline and ensuring accountability on the balance of probability, which NPSC deals with. These two stand vindicated.', ' ', 'In 2014, the High Court, in its judgment on the issue of corruption, nepotism and favouritism, declared itself on the matter: that the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) was not seeking to oversee the NPSC, and EACC for that matter, on mandate issues, but filed the petition in defence of the constitution. In Article 244, the constitution asks the police to be transparent and accountable, not to mention professional, when undertaking their mandate. Corrupt practices such as extorting bribes are contrary to the constitution.', ' ', 'Untold Story ', ' ', 'The untold story is the following: first, the NPSC has failed, woefully at that, in their attempts to stem corruption, both as an offence of indiscipline and crime. Their so-called vetting has not removed the fellows who were caught on camera. This is despite the fact the vetting concentrated too much on finances, rather than human rights violations.', ' ', 'Regardless, vetting as a strategy needs to be rethought, or we also ask hard questions, whether those vetting the police are beyond reproach. Murmurs and rumours abound on whether those in the vetting panels have what it takes to undertake their duty. TheY live in glass houses and hence cannot throw stones to others. ', ' ', 'The second story is that the EACC has also failed to stem corruption from the police service, which has among the highest numbers of the civil service. While it has made efforts to stop police on the roads from taking bribes, their sting operations are not the strategy to ensure this is done.', ' ', 'Many sting operations aimed at individuals have been organised, but there seems to be systemic and structural causes and partakers in bribery, which needs to be stopped. But equally, with empathy, staff of the EACC are mostly violated when effecting arrests of police officers collecting bribes on our roads.', ' ', 'Anti-Bribery Strategy ', ' ', 'From the foregoing, it is, therefore, important for Kenya to craft a strategy that goes beyond institutional mandate, which includes that of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP), to muster the fights against graft.', ' ', 'First, there needs to be a serious public action on those caught on camera and their leaders, up the ladder, even if that ends up with some senior leaders of the police. The second aspect of that strategy is definitely mass resignations of the police leadership, as this would pave way for the reinvention of the police service. That should happen immediately, but with caution, as Kenya faces the general election shortly.', ' ', 'The third aspect would be a public audit of the lifestyles of those in the EACC and the NPSC leadership to begin with, since this systemic issue points directly to their possible collusion in some ways with those criminal elements in the police. For example, during vetting, are some NPSC staff alerting police officers in advance? During sting operations, are EACC staff quipping the police officers on where the raids will be? Hard questions need to be asked to those within both secretariats.', ' ', 'Fourth, the citizens willing to support the fight against graft should be lauded. The appearance of the public fighting graft in 2003, and their sudden disappearance, was because there was lack of sustained pressure on the government to do the same. That is, the levels of bribery in political offices, including the legislature, judiciary and executive, has made the public lethargic to fight graft.', ' ', 'Prosecuting the Corrupt', ' ', 'Fifth, the ODDP should act decisively to deal with prosecution of people involved in graft. Similar to the debate in State House earlier this year, we cannot throw this responsibility around, if the Article 157 still remains intact. It is the ODPP that has the sole responsibility to prosecute. Let the office do its job, and cast aspersions after this work is done.', ' ', 'Sixth, many may cast aspersions on the judiciary, as has always been the case. But a basic law degree teaches one that the courts are only moved in the direction the applicants address them; evidence, law and facts are always the guiding pillars. Let those aggrieved, including the ODPP, address the needs of the courts to deal decisively with bribery. ', ' ', 'Final Word', ' ', 'Finally, within the framework of these multi-faceted nature of bribery, the IPOA needs to also chip in and play its role of prevention or reaction. IPOA has many mandate areas, and corruption could be addressed by other institutions. However, due to the nature of police corruption, IPOA should find a leeway of dealing with it in one of its mandate areas. But this will be a tall order.', ' ', 'The aspects of strategy raised above require a multi-agency approach. The media, which aired the Inspector Fisi expose, should be the straw that breaks the camels back. Media, whether traditional or new, whether print or electronic, or whether visual or audio, has a key role. Exposure of this sleaze is one. Follow-up on how these suspects are prosecuted is another. And finally, ensuring that their stories in jails and how they reform is pivotal. Media raises the issues; but the need for follow up is quintessential.', ' ', '\n']"

Trump, who won\nthe White House with the slimmest of margins, needs every last\nsupporter behind him to push his agenda through a divided\nCongress and potentially win a second term in 2020.', 'The poll surveyed voters who had told Reuters/Ipsos on\nElection Day how they had cast their ballots. While other\nsurveys have measured varying levels of disillusionment among\nTrump supporters, the Reuters/Ipsos poll shows how many would go\nas far as changing the way they voted. The survey was carried\nout first in May and then again in July.', 'In the July survey, 12 per cent of respondents said they\nwould not vote for Trump ""if the 2016 presidential election were\nheld today"" - 7 per cent said they dont know what they would\ndo, and the remaining 5 per cent would either support one of the\nother 2016 presidential candidates or not vote.', 'Eighty-eight percent said they would vote for Trump again, a\nslight improvement over the May figure of 82 percent.

According to\nthe Gallup polling service, former President Barack Obama saw\nhis popularity dip among Democrats and minority voters, though\nit did not come until later in his first term. But Obama, who\nwon the Electoral College with greater margins than Trump, was\nnot as reliant on retaining his core supporters.', 'The minority of Trump voters who said they would not vote\nfor him again gave varying reasons in interviews for why they\nhad changed their minds.', 'Some were tired of his daily trolling of Democrats, the\nmedia and the judiciary.

Political winds\ndo not shift quickly in a strong economy, they said, especially\nwhen many of the presidents decisions have yet to take root.', '""People are still invested in the choices they made"" on\nElection Day, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of\nVirginias Center for Politics.

Im lucky that my husband and friends were very supportive though there never missed a few people who complained about my weight.

The interview was conducted by Ken Opala. Below is a transcript of the interview as recorded during the Question and Answer session, which was granted on the condition that Pike's answers would be accurately quoted by Nairobi Law Monthly. Publisher Ahmesnasir Abdullahi said this week that Nairobi Law Monthly will expose Pike's connections to British intelligence and MI6 in its September issue. "", 'NAIROBI LAW MONTHLY (KEN OPALA): Mr. Pike to what extent do you think you have helped democratise Uganda, and do you consider yourself a key plank in Ugandas move to become a democratic state?', ' ', 'PIKE: Let me just start by giving you some background, so you understand where I am coming from. I was born in Tanzania where my father was a colonial officer. I was born in 1952, and when my father retired, we went back to England. I went to school in England in the 1960s and 70s. After I graduated I became a journalist but then after about two or three years, I wanted to write on things that I was interested in, and I was interested in Africa, having been born and grown up here. So then I went to Tanzania and I became a freelance journalist there for about six months in 1982 writing for the British newspapers.', ' ', 'NLM:  1982?', ' ', ""PIKE: That was a low point in Tanzania, everything was very difficult. In fact I can remember sitting in a cafe reading the Daily News, and getting to page five, and at the bottom of page five in a small story, it said 'attempted coup in Kenya' [laughs]. It wasnt even the lead story, it should have been the lead story. I got very depressed in Tanzania, it was so hopeless, everything was disorganised, the economy wasnt working, there was corruption. So, I went to do a masters in African studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, part of the university of London. At SOAS, I met Ugandans and became friendly with them. We talked about politics: is Africa hopeless? I have just been in Tanzania and everything is a mess. As it turned out, the Ugandan friend who I met doing his PhD was in fact the London representative of Musevenis guerrillas, the National Resistance Army."", ' ', 'NLM: Was it Eriya Kategaya?', ' ', 'No, he was called Ben Matogo and we became close friends. I was interested in the future of Africa, and underdevelopment, and all of these things,  so I used to talk to him a lot about how you can fix Africa, and how can you make Africa better. But I was also a journalist and always looking for a good story. Museveni had started fighting in February 1981. He went abroad and he came back in 1982 to the bush, the Luwero Triangle, so they wanted someone to go and interview him in the bush. Because I was friends with Ben Matogo, I knew all the journalists they were inviting. I was a freelance journalist and much lower in the pecking order than BBC or Reuters, but in the end all these other journalists dropped out.', ' ', 'NLM: So it was a bunch of journalists who were invited?', ' ', 'PIKE: No, they couldnt invite a group because it was too dangerous. Someone had to be smuggled there, and they could only do one at a time. In 1984, I started working for a magazine called South. When I joined South magazine, I said Ill join on one condition, which is that I can leave immediately at short notice if this invitation comes through. The invitation could only be made when everything was in place. South was a progressive magazine trying to get a better economic deal for all developing countries. In June 1984, I got a phone call from Eriya Kategaya, the late minister who just died in Nairobi Hospital telling me to come to Nairobi next week. So I came to Nairobi and went to interview Museveni in the bush. The trip was very dangerous, no one had seen Museveni for two years. There were hundreds and thousands of dead bodies in the Luwero Triangle. By the time I got back a month later to England, it became a very big story on the front pages of many British and international newspapers, on lots of TV stations and radios, the BBC. It was a big shake up for the Obote-2 government, and by that stage, I had become very supportive of the NRA. ', 'NLM: Why had you become supportive?', ' ', 'PIKE: Because I believe they had so many good ideas, that they were principled and they were going to change Uganda and fix a lot of problems that African countries suffer from. As well as being a journalist, I became a supporter of NRA. Just because you are a supporter doesnt mean you are a bad journalist. There are lots of journalists in Europe or America who support the Democratic or Republican party, or the Labour party or Conservative party, but they are still professional journalists. ', ' I did a lot of kind of mobilization work for them in London. About a month after Museveni captured power in January 26, 1986, I got a phone call from Kategaya, saying the Cabinet had just met and we are setting up a newspaper, and the newspaper is going to be called New Vision. By that stage the newspaper had already been coming out since March as a weekly newspaper. I went out for a job interview, I helped them with some issues and then went back to England. I had to give notice to South magazine, so I started work on July 1, 1986 at New Vision.', ""The New Vision inherited some of the facilities of the old government newspaper called Uganda Times. The name was Musevenis ideas, the NRM thing that we want a new vision for Africa. In those days Museveni thought that the NRM revolution was going to change the whole of Africa, not just Uganda. Not many people realise it but historically the NRM revolution was unique because most guerrilla rebellions have outside support. There have only been three guerrilla rebellions that have succeeded without outside support - Uganda, Cuba and China. All other guerrilla rebellions have had outside support. It was very historic, and the NRM/NRA thought it will shake the whole of Africa if people could take up arms and put in power people's governments."", "" You ask the question, how did you further democracy? In those days everyone was trying to fix things in Uganda and there was very little corruption. People were working for low salaries. It was a very idealistic period, and its sad that there are now a lot of problems with corruption. Its sad to think that that original spirit of idealism was not preserved. So my contribution to democratization was by running New Vision. It was a government newspaper but I tried to run it like the BBC, not like Radio Moscow or the Voice of America. The BBC is a government organ but it can also run programmes criticizing or exposing wrongdoing by whichever government is in power, whereas Radio Moscow and Voice of America were outright propaganda outfits. The principle of the New Vision, even though it was a government newspaper, was 'praise where praise is due, and criticism where criticism is due.' I think thats the biggest contribution that I made to democratisation in Uganda. By pushing the New Vision in that direction, even though it was a government newspaper, it was hard hitting, investigative, balanced, professional and also tough on the government. Of course because the government was a good government in those days, they were happy to accept criticism. It didnt bother them because it was really a progressive government."", 'PIKE: No, before Obote collapsed in 1985, he went to Russia and made a deal to get printing equipment. It was a commercial deal and he brought printing equipment from Russia for a printing house for the government newspaper. So there was one Russian newspaper press, but it was very small and it could fit in half of this room, and two East German printing presses. The equipment was poor quality but we just managed for about two years. By that stage, the New Vision was starting to make a bit of money and we managed to buy a Goss Community press with two units.', ' ', 'NLM: Someone told me you said the initial office was more like a Waragi (crude alcohol) bar.', ' ', ""PIKE: I cant remember saying it was like a waragi place but it was very crowded and very basic. Starting the Star is much more complicated than starting the New Vision because with the Star we are trying to compete with two established newspapers, the Standard and the Nation. In the New Vision time we had no money because the whole country had collapsed. None of the other newspapers had any money either so everyone was in the same boat. It was possible to start on a very low level and gradually build up whereas its very difficult to start on a very low level in Kenya. You have to start on a high level, it's tough, and thats what kills off a lot of newspapers."", 'NLM: What will you do when you leave the Star.', ' ', 'PIKE: I dont intend to leave right now but if I did leave, this book only covers my life in Uganda  up to around 1991 and after that it stops. So I want to write the final chapter on the book with my final experiences at the New Vision, why I left New Vision, and a little bit about Kenya.', ' ', 'NLM: In the New Vision there must have been your own articles.', ' ', 'PIKE: There were quite often, You see stories with the byline William Pike on them', 'NLM: Some of the big stories, the initial stories, people think you must have very deep sources or that you are an agent. You can only get those kind of stories if you are really grounded, if you have deep sources or intelligence.', ' ', 'PIKE: You know what its like if you have worked as a journalist in Kenya. People can ring up from intelligence, from NSIS or NIS as it is now. I am sure you yourself have been telephoned by someone from NSIS. ', ' ', 'NLM: I have my sources ', ' ', ""PIKE: I myself have personally been called many times by someone from NIS or NSIS in the last few years saying 'please dont run this story' or 'do you know this or do you know that?' All over the world there is some kind of interaction between journalists and intelligence agencies. So here I have had contact with NSIS just like almost every journalist. In Uganda I had contact with the Ugandan intelligence services. For instance, once I met Jim Muhwezi coming out of the bank."", ' ', 'PIKE: I wasnt so close but I went to his house and all that stuff. He wasnt my closest friend. Anyway, coming out of the bank, there is Jim standing on the street and he says ""come over here"" so I go over to talk to him. He says ""I got a story for you. This morning a Sudanese Antonov has just bombed refugee camps in West Nile."" So then that was the New Vision lead story the next day. I have had contact with Ugandan intelligence, and Kenyan intelligence, but not working for them, just asking them questions.  I have never ever had any contact with British intelligence.', 'In any case, if you speak to some of these diplomats, they are often quite badly informed. The best way to have a good story comes from listening to ordinary people. Thats the secret of good journalism. After I came back from Uganda in 1984, I knew Museveni was going to win. I knew he was going to overthrow Obote. I just knew it. So Museveni asked me to go and meet the British Foreign Office and brief them on what I had seen. So I went to meet the Foreign Office on Musevenis instructions and I told them Museveni is going to win and I could see they were thinking this guy is an idiot, he has been bamboozled by these guerrillas. They were in touch with the highest levels of the (Obote) government but the highest levels of government were telling them crap. They were actually being misled because they didnt listen to ordinary Africans. So the way to get good stories is not to speak to intelligence agencies. The way to get good stories is to talk to ordinary people and just ask them whats going on and very often ordinary people know a lot about whats going on. Thats how we got all these stories in the New Vision which I was very proud of in the early days', ' ', 'NLM: They are powerful stories by the way.', ' ', 'PIKE: They are very powerful stories but they normally involved eye witness accounts of things going on. If it is an intelligence document, it would all be in very abstract language. These were very detailed, colourful, dramatic eye witness stories so its different.', ' ', 'NLM : There is a mention of you in Wikileaks', 'PIKE: Was that when I left New Vision?', ' ', 'NLM: No before 1986', ' ', 'PIKE: I havent seen that one', ' ', 'PIKE: I havent seen that Wikileaks. Have you got it?', ' ', 'NLM: Yes, I can email you a copy.       ', ' ', ""PIKE: E-mail me a copy of that. I havent seen it and I would like to see it. What happened was that the American government was very worried that if Museveni went into Congo it would create a big mess if the Ugandan army went into Congo. T had appealed to so many people to try and get it stopped but the number two in the American embassy invited me for lunch and asked me to 'advise your friends that once you get in, it is very difficult to get out.' I cant remember what I did but I think probably I passed on the message. At that stage they had a cordon sanitaire, a ten kilometre cordon inside Congo, to stop the rebels entering. Anyway send me the Wikileaks. I am not certain if we are talking about the same thing. "", 'NLM:  I was talking to some journalists and they were saying there were only two people who were not reshuffled after 1986 for 20 years, Museveni and Pike.', ' ', 'PIKE: I did a very good job on the newspaper because the New Vision was the most popular newspaper in Uganda by far. Even after the Nation bought the Monitor, the New Vision still used to beat the Monitor. The government newspaper was more popular than a private newspaper. You cant force someone to buy a newspaper, so obviously that was good for the government and they were happy with that. Having said that, there were many times where the New Vision clashed with government ministers, clashed with Museveni, just like any newspaper. You cant run a newspaper and not have friction with government.', ' ', 'NLM: Were you even sued by top fellows in the government?', ' ', 'PIKE: Yes, although people in Uganda dont sue as much as they sue here, here its crazy. I think that was it. Obviously its a benefit if the government newspaper is the top newspaper in the country, if it is the preferred newspaper and is competing on a level playing field with the other papers. ', ' ', 'Of course the other papers, like the Monitor, would complain that we would get leaked inside stories, not that anything was coming from MI6. Monitor was complaining that the Uganda government, or Ugandan intelligence, was giving stories to the New Vision, not to the Monitor. So perhaps that is an unfair advantage, that is being a government newspaper has its benefits. But it has its disadvantages as well. Monitor could speculate on, say, a cabinet reshuffle coming, Dr. Kiyonga is going to be ambassador to Cuba, but the New Vision could never run a story. A government newspaper cant have a speculative story about a cabinet reshuffle, because everyone would assume its based on inside information. So some things that Monitor could do, we could not do.', ' ', 'NLM: So what prompted your resignation?', ' ', 'PIKE: It would have been difficult for me to leave, because people liked the paper, therefore people liked me as a general rule, and because I had been there so long I became like an institution. I worked at the New Vision for 21 years. It was probably the central event of my life, and I dedicated a lot of time to building up the newspaper, but also to building up Uganda as a country. Newspapers campaign on issues. For instance the New Vision was a big supporter of privatisation, so there was much more privatisation in Uganda than in Kenya. You campaign on an issue like privatisation, you campaign for a new constitution or whatever, so the newspaper campaigned for what we thought were progressive changes in Uganda. We invested a lot of time and energy in Uganda and we built up a very good team of journalists at the New Vision.', 'Even so as time passes, to be a manager of a business for 21 years is a long time, and after a while, the owner of the business, the government, starts thinking maybe someone else could do the job better. As I said to you earlier, I always believed that a government newspaper should be like BBC, which broadcasts the negative as well as the positive things about British government, not like Radio Moscow or Voice of America that only reports positive things about the government or the country.  Whereas by the time I left, Museveni thought that the New Vision had become too negative about Uganda. There was quite a long drawn up process, because I would argue with Museveni, or the Ministers of Information, or the chairman of the board, that when you put the negative things in, then the people believe the positive things. If you just put in positive things, people wont take it seriously. ', 'Also I believe that criticism makes you a better person. Indeed Museveni himself, one of the fundamental principles of NRM in the bush, was that any soldier was allowed to stand up and criticise any officer in the bush, as long as he did it in good faith, as long as there was constructive criticism, as opposed to slander or defamation or unfair criticisms. If you got up and genuinely thought something could be done better, and you made that criticism openly and in good faith, you should never be blamed for it. So that was a fundamental principle of the government in the early years. Constructive criticism was encouraged. In my view, New Vision never deviated from the principle of constructive criticism, but I think Museveni felt that the paper had become too negative, and he felt it was time for change. For me, I was so involved in New Vision, I couldnt imagine changing, but actually it was very good that the change came. They wanted me to resign in October 2006, so I said you dont owe me a job, if you are not happy with the way things are going, let me resign. So I resigned and stayed on good terms with all the people, am not on bad terms with anyone. I moved on, and actually it was a very good thing, it was time to move on. What happened then is Patrick Quarcoo (Managing Director of Radio Africa Group) said come to Kenya, let us start a newspaper. Patrick Quarcoo had been trying to start a newspaper in Kenya for several years, so we started a newspaper, the Star.', ' ', 'NLM: Now UPC ( the political party of former president Milton Obote) says that you are a gun for hire, a mercenary who helped cover up killings in northern Uganda, through your writings.', ' ', 'PIKE: The UPC is not a reliable source of information because its Obotes party and they published a lot of false information about me, and about other people. The war in the North was very complicated. It was actually started first of all by the former Obote army called UNLA. Then their rebellion was hijacked by Alice Lakwena, and Joseph Kony is a spin off from Alice Lakwena. Now [if] you went and looked at those old copies of New Vision, I am actually very proud of those newspapers, the old New Visions, because if any academic wants to research the war in the North in future, the most detailed information is in those New Vision articles. And those New Vision articles also include details of killings by the NRA although the vast majority of killings was by the rebels. There were a few massacres by Alice Lakwena but the really bad killings started with Joseph Kony and the LRA. If you have an army in a combat zone, there will always be atrocities, but the NRA was never committing systematic atrocities. This is what I would say, and the UPC would say those things that they say the LRA did, were actually done by the NRA, and the NRA were blaming it on the LRA. But again I go back to what I was saying earlier, listen to ordinary people. If you go to Gulu, speak to ordinary people, not some civil servant drinking in a bar in Gulu. If you go to a village and say, did you lose people during the war, they will say yes, and they will say things like the rebels took our father. You know 99 times out of 100, it will be the rebels who are responsible. So there was no genocide committed by the NRA in Northern Uganda. The NRA is now the UPDF, the government army. There is some stuff in my book about it as well. There was one occasion on which we withheld information about an atrocity that was committed by the government army in Teso, but it is described in the book. But in general we covered all these cases, in Burcoro and elsewhere, so there was no cover up by the New Vision. I still insist that the New Vision provided the most comprehensive and balanced coverage of the war in the North and that included reporting on atrocities by both the rebels and the army. Unfortunately there were many, many more atrocities by the rebels.', ' ', 'NLM: They say you went to Uganda because you were close to Lynda Chalker (former British government minister).', ' ', 'PIKE: These are all UPC rumours, that is why I started by telling you how I went to Uganda. I met met Lynda Chalker when she came to Uganda in1996. I did not meet Linda Chalker in 1986 when Museveni captured power.  Lynda Chalker was smart and recognised that Museveni was here to stay. The British were very frightened of Museveni, because they thought he was an extreme Marxist but Linda Chalker quickly recognised that he was a person she could do business with. Lynda Chalker met Museveni at that stage, but I actually didnt. I met her when we started Capital Radio in Uganda in 1994, and I interviewed her for a show on Capital Radio in those days. That was the first time I met her properly during that radio show.', ' ', 'NLM: So you definitely are not an MI6 agent?  ', ' ', 'PIKE: Honestly not. You know Moses Kuria said I am an MI6 agent. Did you see that on the Internet? It was on Jackal news or something like that. I had an argument with Moses, he sent us an article saying the ICC evidence has been fabricated by Open Society working with the British government (to fabricate) the evidence against Uhuru. He sent a long column around January and I sent it to back to him and I said Moses you cant publish this. There are so many falsehoods in it. For instance, you say the British government pays for all of the ICC but you know Kenya government also funds the ICC because it has to make a contribution under the Rome statute. You cant say its only funded by Britain. I refused to publish the article but then I made a mistake. I sent a copy to Mugambi Kiai and John Githongo and also to John Bradshaw, the Public Affairs correspondent at the British High Commission saying I think you should know what these guys are saying about you. John Bradshaw made the mistake of sending some comments to Moses Kuria and then Moses Kuria said that now there is proof that he (Pike) is an MI6 agent. I forwarded his column to the British High Commission but honestly if you were an MI6 agent, would you really use email to communicate with the High Commission. It would be ridiculous.', 'NLM: But you can always ask for comments from the other side.', ' ', 'PIKE: My argument was that it was intended for publication so even if it wasnt published, it didnt do any harm to send it to some of the people who were mentioned. Moses argued, if you were not intending to publish it, you shouldnt have circulated it all. Thats double standards. So I think Moses Kuria actually had a point. It was a mistake. I shouldnt have sent it to John Githongo, Mugambi or to John Bradshaw. Having said that, if you are a foreign journalist working in Africa, you know what it is like. After I went to Uganda in 1986, I was investigated because there was a rumour that I was a Mossad agent working for Israel, which was also nonsense. They investigated me and found it wasnt true. So the thing is if someone says you are an intelligence agent how do you prove you are not an intelligence agent? How do I know that you (Opala) are not working for NIS?', ' ', 'NLM: I like that', ' ', 'PIKE: In fact how do you know that I (Pike) am not working for NIS? You know you can never prove it. Thats why I told you my personal history how I came into Uganda. Its nothing to do with Lynda Chalker or MI6. It was to do with my upbringing. I wanted to come back to Africa. I wanted to do journalism in Africa. I went to Tanzania, it didnt work out, and by coincidence I met Ugandans', ' ', 'PIKE: We have not been supporting ODM. People dont believe it but when you are starting a new newspaper in Kenya, (you are challenging )two giants, the Standard and Nation. How do you get some unique selling point to eat into their market? What we were doing in the last five years is we were supporting the reform agenda. We were very much working with civil society doing stories. So thats why we had writers like John Githongo, Pheroze Nowrojee, Yash Ghai, Mugambi Kiai and these kind of people writing for us. Ngunjiri wasnt working for ODM originally. He was doing Kikuyus for Change. So we were supporting the reform agenda. I think by the way it was good to support the reform agenda because they were pushing issues on the constitution. Unfortunately people confused supporting the reform agenda with supporting ODM. Actually what I would say about ODM is that a lot of stories like about Raila Odinga appointing his relatives to be ambassadors, Beryl Odinga getting into trouble with the sale of properties from Railways Pension Board, stories that were very embarrassing for ODM and Raila, and they came out in the Star. Even the story of Fidel Odinga threatening a driver when he was in a traffic jam. All these stories came in the Star. We werent supporting ODM but we were supporting the reform agenda and that I think is what caused the confusion sometimes. Another thing that caused confusion was that we believed that the ICC was a big issue and that it wasnt just an imperialist plot because after all it was the Kenyans that sent it to the Hague. We believed that the ICC was going to cause a lot of problems so it should be discussed and covered in detail. Unfortunately by discussing and covering the ICC in detail from the beginning of the case,  that was misinterpreted as favouring one candidate whereas we thought this is an important issue that needs to be discussed. It cant be swept under the carpet.', ' ', 'NLM: Do you think time is ripe for New Vision to be privatised?', ' ', 'PIKE: So while I was at New Vision, I thought it should be privatised because there is nothing wrong with a newspaper supporting the NRM just like the Guardian supports the Labour party in England, the New York Times supports the Democratic Party but they are completely private.  So why cant the New Vision be private and support NRA? So, 40 percent was privatised in around 2005. It was sold on the stock market and a few years ago another 20 percent was sold so its now 60 percent private and 40 percent government, which I think is probably a good balance.', 'NLM: Item 7 (question about New Vision and Tiny Rowland).', ' ', 'PIKE: Tony Rowland never had anything to do with New Vision. I never ever met Tony Rowland. I have read about him and actually I would like to have met him because he was a historic figure from the 60s and 70s in Africa.  I was telling you Museveni never had any external support in the bush wars until after Obote was overthrown in a coup in July 85 by Tito Okello and Bazilio Okello. Obote went to Zambia and then they started peace negotiations in Nairobi with NRA which went on for six months but then in the end Museveni just took control of the government. In that period it became obvious to people that Museveni was going to take power so these vultures like Tony Rowland immediately started offering assistance and money. Tony Rowland lent his private jet to Museveni to move around to get some support. So Tony Rowland arrived at that stage and gave some limited support to Museveni and NRA. Before that the only external support was in 1982 when Col Gaddafi gave a little bit of external training in Libya to about a hundred soldiers. Then just before the coup in 1985, he did an air drop of some arms. Then after the coup Mozambique and Tanzania sent rifles to Museveni but their external support only came when it was obvious that the Obote regime was collapsing or had collapsed. ', 'So Tiny Rowland never contributed anything to the New Vision directly or indirectly. I never met him. I never met any representative of Lonrho so we didnt have anything to do with them. The people who actually bankrolled the New Vision were the Russians because the Russians actually contributed something like a million dollar loan when they sent the original printing equipment which was enough to get started. They never got paid because the government said it couldnt afford to pay and in about 1990  Uganda, with the World Bank loan, they paid eight cents on the dollar to the Russians. So the Russians lost out badly and they contributed. New Vision lost 25,000 dollars in its first year which the government gave. After that it only survived on its own resources. The new Vision now is probably worth twenty or thirty million dollars. All the government contributed at the beginning was twenty five thousand dollars and a pick up. ', 'NLM: So you raised the stature of this.', ' ', 'PIKE: There were lots of people. What you have to remember was that in Uganda in those days everyone was working to rebuild the country. People were thinking collectively, they werent thinking selfishly. So it was a different period and people were working on low salaries, people were working hard, everyone was doing their best. Okay, maybe I was giving some leadership in the New Vision but it was a team effort with many people contributing.', 'NLM: They say that you must have hidden some information about the death of Fred Rwigyema (first leader of the RPF who died in 1990 at the start of inthe invasion of Rwanda). ', 'PIKE: There was a lot of false information and its very difficult to know how Rwigyema died. The story is in my book and you can read it. Probably he was shot at the border because Museveni had called them and asked them to come back and stop the invasion.Then some renegade RPF officers just shot him. A month later Kagame came back from Fort Leavenworth. He was in America and shot the renegade officers because Rwigyema was one of his friends and took control. Its not clear exactly but some of those stories were covered in detail in the New Vision. ', 'NLM: I was in Uganda and they were saying that you want to launch a newspaper.', ' ', 'PIKE: There are so many rumours but I am not planning to start a newspaper in Uganda because first of all, the Star is too much work. Its so time consuming. By the time I left I only had to work about four or five hours per day at New Vision because it was running very smoothly. Its such hard work of starting a newspaper, and even now five years later it is still a lot of work. So firstly I dont have the time, secondly we dont have enough money to do it, because Star is only just breaking even, but thirdly, I think its not such a good idea because we have Capital Radio in Uganda, and Beat FM.', ' ', 'NLM: Five of them?', ' ', 'PIKE: No, no, Radio Africa has five radio stations in Kenya. In Uganda we have Beat FM and Capital FM, and I run those radio stations, so every month I go back for two, three days to Uganda, just to check and monitor their operations. But I dont think we will plan to do a newspaper in Uganda.', ' ', 'NLM: If you go to the Internet, you are considered among the wealthiest Ugandans.', ' ', 'PIKE: That is also so much bull****. Obviously I am not one of the poorest people in Uganda. What I would say is obviously I am more comfortably off than many Africans, but I wouldnt say I am one of the 100 wealthiest people. And by the way in Uganda, there was a leadership code, you had to declare your assets every year, and all my assets were always declared, and nothing was hidden, I am happy to tell you.', ' ', '  ']"
