Food kiosks or vibanda have been shut down, even though it would appear there is no proof of the outbreak originating there.

What is rather visible is the usual cliche strategies that have failed to yield a fruit for decades.', 'As society, we tend to glorify those implicated in graft; celebrate their brilliance to manipulate the system, idolise and second them for their brave acts. Corruption, an economic crime, impedes economic growth and the well-being of the people. The more corruption permeates across countries, spreading like a pandemic, the more it downgrades and eliminates values and ethics. Corruption becomes institutionalised, and a lot of people see it as a way of life, and the only way to get an edge in every single field of endeavour.', 'There are a number of ways in which corruption retards growth. Corrupt countries will likely have low investment rates because investors will not want to work with officials who will later lay claim to their proceeds and kickbacks. A corrupt system also mirrors lawlessness in other state institutions. Potential investors feel safe investing in a country where governance systems function efficiently. Where they can feel, touch and identify with the leadership of the day. The reason is, in case of any harassment from the bureaucrats, probably trying to solicit bribes before and after issuance of licenses or premises, investors can turn to the courts for recourse.', 'Are contemporary governments incapable of learning from history? Countries where corruption and financial improprieties are rampant have got very low scores on growth in totality. ', 'According to Transparency International, Mobutu Sese Seko is estimated to have looted Zaire to the tune of $5 billion, while Zambian President Fredrick Chiluba embezzled and stole up to $80 million. None of these two countries, and many others which have had extravagant leaders, can claim to have tremendously progressed in the eyes of the world.', 'Kenya is no exception in this fiasco. Going by a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers in February this year, Kenya is the third most corrupt country in the world. According to the survey, Kenya only fared better than France and South Africa. Nevertheless, Kenyans were not shocked by this embarrassing survey since for quite some time, we have dominated and maintained a top 10 position among the most corrupt countries in the world. If this is not a reflection of how things have continued to fall apart, then perhaps I do not know exactly what this survey was all about!', 'No sooner is a leader or a high ranking government official in this country accused of corruption than the said individual retreats back to his or her tribal enclave to solicit support and subsequently blocks further investigations. Sometimes the accused pay people from their backyard to accompany them when summoned to appear before court or the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. This choreographed process is primarily meant to herald to the government that you cannot prosecute one from our very own ancestral soil. The fact that key government appointments such as ambassadorial posts, parastatals and much-coveted Cabinet and principal secretary jobs have since Independence been based on ethnic numerical factors  whereby the tribe with the majority of voters gets more or influential posts  makes it easy for graft suspects to manipulate their people, and create a scenario that they are being targeted or purged politically. This ugly scenario has in most cases succeeded to insulate the suspects from further investigations, frustrating justice.', 'Accountability institutions must not relent in the war on corruption. Most cases have gone uninvestigated due to inadequate resources and lack of political goodwill. This helps corrupt individuals to go scot free, derailing the fight against corruption. In certain cases, the EACC has gone ahead to clear corruption suspects. And when fresh evidence comes up, as was the case in the NYS Scandal, the EACC issues glib clarifications, invalidating its earlier decision to clear the suspects.', 'Such moves undermine the credibility of such an institution constitutionally mandated to lead the war on corruption. This underscores the need for seriousness at the EACC and also the need to have committed, competent people at the commission with unblemished character.', 'Kenyans are now betting on Bishop Eliud Wabukala to deal with graft, since he is deemed to have come from a world of sanctity and cleanness. No amount of rhetoric will make a difference if people cannot see and identify with EACC actions towards taming those who steal from the public coffers.', 'Corruption by all definitions is the worst economic tragedy to have ever befell governments under.', 'For the war against corruption to be won, especially in Africa, the presidents, who double as commanders in chief, should lead it. This is by virtue of the enormous power they wield. It is, therefore, logical to expect them to use that power to curb graft with a top-down approach. We should also not leave it to the mandated institutions only. There has to be fundamental changes in our culture and attitudes. We should train our children in sound morals, give them a sense of civic duty and service to humanity, even if it means incorporating these values in our education curriculum system.', 'The next President after the August 8 General Election should also prioritise having more women in his government. This will be a huge leap in the public sector.', 'A number of studies show women are less susceptible to corrupt deals, partly due to a different perspectives they have about life as compared to men. They are, therefore, likely to bring values and a much desired work ethic to the public service.', 'The country is collectively holding its breath for a president who will send corruption to an early grave.', 'The writer is the executive director, Governance Pillar Organization', '\n']"

The riots began not after airing of the famous recording of the beating silly of one Rodney King by White police, but after the four officers responsible were found not guilty, in what many considered a miscarriage of justice. Rioting began and wouldnt stop for almost a week, when not only the National Guard but also the Army and Marine Corps were forced to intervene.', 'By the third day, George H W Bush sent in the army and the marines, boosting the military presence to 13,500 troops. By the time the riots were over, 53 people had been killed, over 2,000 injured, and over 11,000 arrested. The property that was damaged was estimated at over $1 billion (over Sh100 billion), making it the largest scale American consequential riot since the 1960s.', 'The LA riot and nearly all other major riots in the US have one thing in common: Triggered by police action with social strife, racial inequality and high youth unemployment in the Black community serving as the propane gas lit by the cops action.', 'Indeed, the relationship between police and the Black community continues to be tense, despite efforts by many to defuse the tensions as high up as the presidency itself  the last President, to be sure.', 'One contributing factor is increased militarisation of the police, where wearing helmets and masks, toting assault rifles, and riding in mine-resistant armoured vehicles has become common, unlike any other time in the US history. As the countrys major civil rights organisation ACLU has noted, the change in equipment is too often paralleled by a corresponding change in attitude, whereby police conceive of themselves as at war with communities rather than as public servants concerned with keeping their communities safe.', 'President Uhuru Kenyatta has not so quietly armed the police with all manner of anti-riot machinery and gear to keep our communities safe, but in efforts to prepare and quash any mass action that could and would ensue were he and Jubilee to yet again rig the election. This is simply unacceptable and cannot be allowed to come to pass were they to try.', 'The militarisation of police in the US is primarily to protect cities against criminality and other forms of hooliganism, not to ensure the President clings to powermilitarisation of police elsewhere is to ensure those in power cling on, which is, again, simply unacceptable.', 'The right to be governed by those who have won the hearts and minds of the majority of voters is and must be unassailable, unfettered and sacrosanct. To do otherwise is the very definition of anarchy, chaos and violence, none of which anyone would want for our country.', 'Put another way, history teaches us you can only oppress and suppress the people only so long; in time, those very people say enough is enough and that the time is upon us. Uhuru and Jubilee have a choice to let the country vote peacefully in a fair, open and transparent election or go the route theyre clearly preparing to  predictable consequences.', 'The wise choice is obvious for those who love and care about our beloved country.', 'Omwenga is a legal expert and political commentator in the United States', '\n']"

At Independence, the founding fathers of Kenya used Luo symbols of\ngood omens and incorporated them in our Coat of Arms. In Luo tradition, if you\nwanted to settle in a new land, you tied a rooster outside your hut and left an\naxe next to it.

Indeed, the news came by noon that day that Jomo Kenyatta\nhad died. To some, omens are the voice of the gods, to others they are pure\nconjecture. The ancient Babylonians and Arabs were astute astrologers with an\nelaborate method of interpreting omens from studying the stars. The ancient\nRomans employed an augur who guided the councils in times of peace and war\nthrough interpretation of omens. It fell on him to determine the best time for\nany action from planting of seeds to going to war. They did this by observing\nnatural phenomena, animal or bird sounds (like an owls hooting), direction of\nbirds flight, direction of lightning, eclipses, etc. The Roman augur gave us\nthe English word augur, which is still in common usage (to augur well or\nbadly).', ' ', 'Interpretation\nof omens was a common practice in Biblical times and even the birth of Jesus\nChrist became known to the world as a result of omen interpretation: The wise\nmen from the East followed a star to Jerusalem where they learnt of the birth\nof our Saviour.', ' ', 'ASTROLOGY IN POLITICS', ' ', 'In\nAmerica, Nancy Reagan was famous for consulting astrologers when making an\nimportant political decision. It is not clear if the advice of astrologers\nhelped her husband Ronald Reagan to rule America, but the use of astrologers is\nnot new in social and political circles. Astrology in itself is searching for a\ngood or bad omen in the stars. If, for instance, one planet or star is\ncrossing the celestial equator, one could interpret that as either a good or\nbad omen, depending on so many other factors. When certain planets are in line\nor if another is rising, then the astrologers have their way of linking such\noccurrences to events on earth. Professional astrologers are said to predict\nthe future with such occurrences and often link that to past occurrences under\nthe similar set of observations.

And this compares to the harm sport management would do if new athletes were to be denied a chance to compete with previous gold medallists merely because they have not reached the top before. Yet it is not once or twice that we have seen new athletes beat older ones when they are given an equal chance to compete. All presidential candidates should have been offered an equal and same debate platform to compete.', 'Why then did the two sets of the better and lesser-known presidential candidates boycott the running mates debate?', 'Both the lesser and the better-known presidential candidates seem to have no faith in the organisers of the debate, thinking they have already rigged the debate against them, just like most Kenyans justifiably think our entire system is rigged against them through institutional negative ethnicity and corruption.', 'Bigger boys also missed the debate because they think they can browbeat the debate organisers into organising the debate to suit their political interests. After all, Jubilee Party and the government are used to armtwisting everyone, and getting away with it. In any case, the debate is likely to harm Jubilee more than anybody else through exposure of their failures that can easily reduce their appeal to the people. NASA had every reason to attend the presidential debate as a national platform to expose the failures of Jubilee, and explain their manifesto and vision to the people. And while Jubilee has reason to fear exposure of its weaknesses by the opposition, NASA has absolutely nothing to fear because they have not been in government to make mistakes.

', 'The dispute over the printing of presidential ballot papers in respect of which the Court of Appeal delivered its verdict on Thursday to allow the printing of presidential ballots by Al Ghurair Printing and Publishing Company was the most poignant pointer of the major obstacles to a free and fair election. However, there are numerous other cases pending in court, whose verdicts may yet throw new spanners into the works.', 'As regards the printing of the ballots, I am aware of at least five cases litigated before the Public Procurement Review Board, the High Court. ', 'In regards to technology, which the Court of Appeal in the Maina Kiai Judgement declared must be the principal mode of conducting the general election, there are three cases pending in the High Court. This gloomy scenario is further complicated by two other cases. In one of them, NASA is challenging IEBCs decision to transfer and gazette returning officers, whilst in the other, a voter is seeking a declaration that presidential election results be announced within seven hours after the closure of the voting exercise.', 'From the outset, we acknowledge the undoubted right of any political party or citizen to present any grievance before court. Indeed, the twin rights of securing protection of law and access to justice, enshrined in Articles 27 and 48 of the Constitution are two of the most precious constitutional rights in any working democracy. Yet, even by our societys litigious standards, the legal challenges facing the August 8 polls are both unprecedented and disconcerting. ', 'Of greater significance, besides the high number, the timing and the subject matter of these cases lend credence to the rising concerns that the ultimate objective of these cases is to delegitimise in advance the outcome of the presidential election, which would pave way to nullification of a political victory by Jubilee candidate President Uhuru Kenyatta.', 'To my mind, these concerns and fears are valid particularly with respect to the presidential election. Let me explain. Under Article 86 of the Constitution, the IEBC is required to ensure, among other things, that the voting system is simple, accurate, verifiable, the votes are counted, tabulated and the results announced promptly, and appropriate structures and mechanisms to eliminate electoral malpractice are put in place. The Elections Act, 2011, which was extensively amended last year provides the practical means for the IEBC to realise the principles and goals set out in Article 86. ', 'Last year, Cord succeeded in its campaign to remove the Isaack Hassan-led IEBC and effect the comprehensive review of the Elections Act. It is, therefore, surprising that opposition leaders led by Raila Odinga have missed no opportunity to call into question the integrity and authority of the new electoral commission. Public confidence in the IEBC is vital to ensure credible polls but the constant harassment and undermining of its authority through political actions and judicial decisions have undeniably made it difficult for Kenyans to trust it. In my view, it is unlawful for anyone to undermine the authority of any public institution. ', 'Specifically, the Electoral Code of Conduct requires all and sundry to acknowledge the authority of the commission in the conduct of the election, reassure voters with regard to its impartiality and to accept the final outcome of the election, subject to the right to present a petition to an election court. There are two things worth noting in regards to the time and space for the IEBC to do its job. First, the Elections Act, 2011 as amended in September 2016 and March this year set out strict timelines for the electoral commission to undertake specified activities. ', 'Occasionally, the courts have varied these timelines and one of the consequences is that party primaries disputes are yet to be concluded. Second, Section 109 of the Elections Act provides that IEBCs power to make regulations shall be exercised only after a draft of the proposed regulations has been approved by the National Assembly, at least six months preceding a general election. ', 'The idea here is that at least six months to the general election, candidates and the voters should be aware what the law is and precisely how the IEBC will do its job. Unfortunately, courtesy of these unending court cases, the electoral laws remain in a state of flux, less than a month to the polls and the IEBC cannot be sure of it can do and what it cant in discharging its mandate, supposedly as an independent body. The conclusion is irresistible: The way things are going it will be a miracle, if not impossible, for IEBC to ensure that the August 8 General Election comply with the principles of free and fair elections set out in Articles 81 and 86 of the Constitution. ', 'In Ledama Ole Kina vs Samuel Tunai & 9 Others the Court of Appeal held that an election that is not conducted in accordance with the principles laid out in Articles 81 and 86 is not free and fair, is invalid, without more. ', 'It bears noting that the main reason why the decision of the Supreme Court in Raila Odinga vs IEBC & Others is oftenly criticised is because of its apparent failure to examine the impact of Articles 81 and 86 on resolution of election disputes.Truth be told. It is extremely hard to have a genuine trial in a presidential petition due to the ill-advised timelines on filing and determination. Further, courtesy of the court decisions in the Kiai case that effectively appointed 290 presidential returning officers presidential election petitions in Kenya cannot be heard and determined on merit. What this means is that realistic presidential petition must be fought around the principles of Articles 81 and 86, which are broad enough to invite nullification on account of any kind of misdemeanour and transgression of this or the other legal provision, regulation or judicial standard. In plain terms, a presidential petition founded on Articles 81 and 86 would empower the judges to nullify the results on practically any kind of transgressions that are inevitable in any election or human endeavour. ', ' Viewed this way, Kenyans should have reason to worry about the impact of the concluded and pending cases on the August 8 presidential election. No doubt several of the timelines have been violated, NASA has questioned its authority and judges have cast aspersions on the IEBC, which seems to have been impeded at every turn and then questioned about its preparedness to do its job. When all the decisions are finally made by the courts IEBC will have too little time to do a credible job, its capacity and reputation will be limited and its confidence shaken. Backed with court decisions questioning IEBCs compliance with principles set out in Articles 81 and 86, the irresistible conclusion is that in the end the decisions in the concluded and pending court cases will provide major grounds for nullification of presidential results by the Supreme Court. In other words, these cases are not just about how the general election will be conducted but they amount to a pre-emptive strike on legitimacy of the outcome particularly in the presidential election.

This is worrying.', 'Electoral violence is not an event in itself but usually a result of structural and institutional push factors that are often aggravated by incumbent regimes through omission and commission. If the party primaries and intolerance we saw recently are anything to go by, then the country should be prepared for an aftermath worse than what has been witnessed before.', 'The Kenyan political architecture of winner-takes-all and literally eats meat as others salivate has not helped. Political violence is not any different from terrorism, and there is no shortage of actions that are clearly preparing the country for a contested presidential outcome.', 'Political violence and extremism are not phenomena confined to Kenya or to Africa by extension. The Australian government defines it as a willingness to use violence or support the use of violence by others to promote a political ideology or religious goal. ', 'Consequently, political violence can be seen as a recourse when all else seems to be against what the people perceive as just. Some defence submissions through lawyers during the tail-end proceedings of the Kenyan cases at the International Criminal Court held that political violence could have been sparked by impunity and mistrust of institutions and was not necessarily planned. If the argument that the 2007-08 violence haphazardly sparked without any formal planning holds water, then the same could be awaiting the country come August this year if the institutions charged with electoral management do not live up to the task devoid of political manoeuvres.', 'Most scary is the involvement of top presidential contenders in reckless statements during this period. Incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta is out of order making a declaration that he will relinquish power should he lose. The Constitution explicitly spells out the succession process, and any presumption to the contrary is only farcical. Piling pressure on other presidential contenders to proclaim that they will accept defeat only fuels the suspicions that the government could be keen on an unfair process.', 'The implausible inspection of the voter register by a firm, whose experience in such is unknown and a non-participatory ballot printing tender award has not helped things either. When the electoral management agency seems reluctant to create public participation and feedback mechanisms, and only responds to political statements, while advocating patience from the public, then clearly the gods are unsettled and we have every reason to be anxious. ', 'It is insensitive to imagine that an environment satiated with socioeconomic marginalisation, poor governance, corruption, palpable looting of public resources and human rights abuses iced in police brutality can be short of participants in violent extremism. The food emergency and youth unemployment have not helped and no one would envy incumbency in this state of affairs. It is, therefore, understandable when the top leadership overreacts once in a while, when citizens do not seem to acknowledge one or two achievements here and there.', 'As Albert Einstein rightly predicated, peace is not merely absence of war but the presence of justice, of law, of order  that is government. As the Election Day approaches, it is not late for the political players and relevant institutions, including the IEBC and the judiciary, to start doing things right.', 'Political rallies that do not contribute to peace through perceived and real objectivity will bears no fruits. Disheartening is the lacklustre attitude religious institutions and civil society have about pushing for a credible electoral process. The international community, through the European Union Observation Mission, has rightly pointed to possibilities of a sham election, and this cannot be helpful. The Interior ministry keeps on boasting of its preparedness to deal with any violence, and this only confirms governments clemency for electoral fraud, and that the people must not question the outcome. ', 'A persuasion driven by intimidation to cleanse a plan towards a botched process cannot be allowed in the name of preaching peace. ', 'Also, inauspicious is the reality that under these circumstances, the government still has a constitutional mandate to protect peoples lives and property, and coordinate all agencies to ensure a credible election. The government bears the greatest responsibility for a credible and peaceful election. It is a requisite that a sitting president not only focuses on his reelection but also adheres to the Constitution that he swore to abide by and protect. This is a tough call, especially in Africa, where power and economic survival are inseparable, and probably a question that Kenyans need to deal with at some point. ', 'The implementation of Chapter 6 of the Constitution that articulates leadership and integrity has not been effectively managed by agencies concerned and this only aggravates the situation. Considering the dominance and economic opportunities that the presidency presents, maybe it is time Kenyans thought of providing for a transition period where a sitting president still considering reelection relinquishes power and an objective body takes over for a specified period. This could reduce rampant political interference with independent institutions that manage elections.', 'It is comprehensible that these independent institutions are only independent when there is political will. History confirms that electoral management agencies in this country hardly resist any overtures to subvert the will of the people. The drafters of our Constitution must have assumed that everyone ascending to the top office would be sensitive to the letter and the spirit of the supreme law, and that wisdom would prevail. A fallacy. With the antecedents, we wonder at what became of the presidency as the symbol of national unity.', '\n']"

In their minds they pay politicians to\nwork, not to campaign for themselves, print posters of themselves, or talk\nthemselves up at rallies every year.

I, on the other hand, think it has to do with Maslows hierarchy of\nneeds.', ' ', 'In broad strokes,\nMaslows hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology that argues that human\nneeds are arranged in a hierarchy. At the very bottom of this hierarchy are physiological needs  basic needs that are vital to\nsurvival, such as water, air, and food. According to Dr Maslow, before these\nbasic needs are met, all other higher needs, such as esteem, need for meaning and appreciation for beauty, are secondary. In other words, if we need food, then little else matters until we have something to eat.', ' ', 'But, in Maslows\nwords, ...what happens to mans desires\nwhen there is plenty of bread and when his belly is chronically filled? ... At\nonce, other (and higher) needs emerge and these, rather than physiological\nhungers, dominate.

But I am worried, so are many other Kenyans I have talked to. Our worry is triggered by the following observations.', 'First, if the polls are indeed going to be free and fair, why are the security forces arming themselves to the teeth and giving threats that we are ready for you? Why should the government be worried about citizens going about the business of electing their representatives in a free and fair election? Who is planning to upset the citizens by denying them the chance to elect their leaders freely and fairly? Does the government know something we dont?

All Kenyans know this years General Election is on August 8. The most puzzling thing is that there are still many cases in court regarding disputes among party nominees to stand for various and different posts.

Why is it not possible for the IEBC to take technical representatives of the two major coalitions through the process of printing these ballot papers so as to ensure that the correct number of presidential ballot papers are printed? What is so difficult about that?', 'Four, the law requires that the single voters register be available for public inspection ahead of Election Day. The IEBC seems to be dragging its feet on this issue. Does it mean that the electoral commission is not confident about the validity of the voters register? My take is that the sooner the register is put in the public domain, the better. The case filed by Gladwell Otieno speaks for itself. Most Kenyans are of the same mind as Gladwell. We want a credible, valid, non-polluted and true voters register, in which the names of bona fide Kenyans appear as voters in the August 8 election.', 'Five, rumour has it that at least 100,000 Ugandans were registered on the other side of the border to take part in the Kenyan election. In fact, these are not rumours: They are backed by facts. Fact number one: A Kenyan woman MP was arrested during the voter registration, recruiting people in Uganda to register as voters in Kenya. The case was widely publicised in the media. Nobody knows what became of either the MP or the people she tried to register. Can the IEBC clarify this matter? Fact number two: Our private eye in Uganda tells us that it is no longer speculation that the 100,000 or so Ugandans have been registered as voters in Kenya. This issue was recently discussed at very high levels between a visiting Jubilee delegation and Ugandan authorities. Can the IEBC pronounce itself on this? This phenomenon may very well be going on across other Kenyan borders.', 'Five  on the same issue as registering other people to vote in our elections  rumour has it that Chinese, working on the SGR were given Kenyan identity cards to be registered as voters. Now this could be far fetched, but the rumour can only be put to rest if the IEBC avails the register for public inspection and correction in good time before the election.', 'Six, questions arise regarding importing voters from outside. The first is to do with the polling stations at which these various outsiders will vote. How are they to be fitted into appropriate polling stations? The second question is to do with the candidates they are going to vote for. Can externally recruited candidates really follow the six-piece voting pattern demand by the two leading political outfits? I think not. The only likely thing is that these externally recruited voters have one mission: To vote in the presidential election. Period! That perhaps would explain why there were two million people in the 2013 election, who voted specifically for the presidency. Hence also the importance of looking into the possibility of printing extra ballot papers destined to serve this special constituency of voters. As our people say, please do not wish away this possibility that easily; you may equally easily plant your seeds in my rain!', 'The moral of all this is that the IEBC has the challenge to follow the law to the letter, and to stick to constitutional provisions word for word. The IEBC must also go an extra mile to make the Kenyan people confident that it is up to the task. Let the IEBC not gloss over the issue of the register: It can make or break Kenya.', 'Jubilee, particularly the President and the Deputy President, must realise that the responsibility of a government is very different from that of the opposition. The government has the responsibility of taking care of the interests of all Kenyans, including the opposition. It is not a very easy responsibility to handle, especially when you can easily get upset that somebody is trying to get your job. But then that is where there must be a difference between democratic statesmanship and mere thirst to cling to power.', 'The security forces must also be aware that their behaviour in the past put this country through a lot of pain, anguish and unnecessary loss of life. I remember that day when, in broad daylight, thugs in Naivasha stopped matatus coming from Nairobi and headed to Western Kenya and literally pulled passengers out, bludgeoning them to death with machetes. What was surprising is that people in military uniform stood by and simply watched as all this happened. This horrible sight was broadcast on our television screens. It traumatised many Kenyans for months. Recalling that horrible sight still traumatises me to this very day. My plea to all security forces is that they should observe strict neutrality during this election if not at all times. Let all civil servants be CIVIL servants, serving the state of Kenya and not the government of Kenya. Governments come and go and the state of Kenya is what we all have in common, no matter our other differences. ', 'And finally, a plea to political parties and candidates: This stupid practice of buying IDs from voters to reduce voter turn out in the strongholds of opponents is one the most stupid, short-sighted and self serving undertaking I completely detest. But I blame the government. ', 'Our government boasts of having one of the most effective intelligence gathering systems in Africa. How can a thing like this go on for months without the government being aware of it and stopping it? I raised this matter in our meeting in Kisumu and I was surprised how ignorant our senior state officials were about it? Either the intelligence gathering system is sleeping on the job or the government, as a whole, is complicit in this matter. The gravity of this buying of IDs is that its adverse effects will be felt way after the general election. Many people will begin looking for new IDs. This is unnecessarily costly and a gory waste of both time and resources.', '\n']"
