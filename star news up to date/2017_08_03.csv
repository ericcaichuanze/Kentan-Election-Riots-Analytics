Ultimately, we shall experience a heavy reduction of importation once the situation normalizes, she said in a statement.', 'In June, the agriculture CS Willy Bett said the government will use the SGR to ensure maize is delivered on time to ease shortage of flour and congestion at the Port of Mombasa.', 'He said using the road alone as the only means of transport was posing as a challenge due to the high uptake of the grain by millers.', 'In the same month, millers had also blamed the shortage of wheat flour in the country to congestion of vessels at the Port of Mombasa. The millers said they were losing a lot of money as they could not supply commodities to consumers on time.', 'There are many ships lining up at the port waiting to be offloaded, and priority is being given to white maize to ease the shortage of flour. We have white maize, yellow maize and wheat at the port, hence the delay for millers to get the commodities in a timely manner, a miller said.', 'According to the ministry of agriculture, there are two ships carrying 400,000 bags and another 40,000 metric tonnes which are currently being off loaded at the port. Three more ships carrying imported maize are waiting to dock. So far, 5,084,283 million bags of maize have been imported from various countries.', '\n']"

Prior to 1990, the primary source was Official Development Agencies, such as the World Bank and similar agencies. The tide has however changed over the years and ODA is no longer a major source of funding. Today in Kenya, ODA is a minority share in the overall make-up of development finance. This is declining even more, considering the middle-income status of the country limits access even further. Instead, tax revenues, private sector foreign direct investments, and remittances have replaced ODA. New donors are also emerging, such as China, which largely focus on providing financing for infrastructure projects. ', 'This calls for a renewal of policy dialogue between policymakers and DFIs on how best to tap the emerging sources of finance. There is need to address the triple questions of why, how and what of DFIs. The why, is relevant to ensure both policy and strategy are aligned to new sources of finance. Given their mandate to mobilise resources, DFIs are at the centre of emerging consensus around the role of the private sector in meeting development objectives. In a major policy departure from traditional donors, DFIs employ a bottom-up demand-driven approach to development. This means in order to do a deal, DFIs require a potential client to approach them with a potential investment or funding request. On the contrary, traditional development agencies deploy a top-down supply side driven approach. This is where projects are designed to achieve desired development objectives or outcomes. ', 'Second is the how relating to the instruments of intervention such as grants, loans, equity, quasi-equity, guarantees, and credit insurance. Grants are on the decline, and quasi-equity and credit insurance are on the rise. Loans are likely to come in the form of patient capital that is long term in nature, reflecting a higher risk tolerance. In addition, in the place of grants, technical assistance helps prepare and mature an investment opportunity to make it bankable in advance of the final investment decision. For DFIs, the how is a delicate balance between development impact and financial sustainability. Often times, the higher the development impact, the lower the financial sustainability. ', 'Finally, the what specifies the regions and the sectors most suited for use of DFIs. As government agencies, it means the what aligns with government priorities. However, DFIs are not suited for all government priorities. DFIs work with private sector players, and that means all projects show commercial viability in the long term. Some of the projects can be seen as experiments with viability, yet the risks will often be too great for private sector. In such cases, DFIs are pioneers and first movers that open new opportunities. ', '\n']"

This was manifest in the plea by a shell-shocked IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati for police protection.', 'The plea spoke a terrifying truththat people critical to a credible election, hence a peaceful Kenya, are exposed and unprotected. Msando twice reported threats to his life to police without, it now ensues, any response.

Specifically, retired President Daniel Moi in 1992 and 1997; and retired President Mwai Kibaki in 2007.', 'This would seem to argue that the odds against defeating an incumbent Kenyan president are so steep as to be virtually insurmountable. And that this rule would apply even to a politician as formidable as the former Prime Minister Raila Odinga, who is currently running even with President Uhuru Kenyatta (according to most pollsters) as we head into the final days of the current election season.', 'But that is only one factor.', 'The second, and equally valid and historically verifiable factor is that no Kenyan president seeking reelection has ever got more than 50 per cent of the vote. We note that in 1992 Moi got only 36 per cent of the vote; in 1997 Moi did only slightly better and got 40 per cent; and when Kibaki was reelected in 2007, he got 45 per cent.', 'Broadly speaking, there is no mystery as to why Kenyan presidents tend to have, on the one hand, a very strong chance of reelection; while on the other hand, they tend to be less than overwhelmingly popular. The key determinant of this odd pattern is that in all those elections past, the president was up against a divided opposition, and faced at least two prominent candidates each with strong regional support.', 'The total vote for the other candidates was always more than what the president himself received. Indeed, in all those cases, those who had supported the opposition candidates were left to gnash their teeth and ask in fury why their candidates had not managed to unite before the election.', 'But none of that mattered. The serving president was duly sworn in for yet another five-year term.', 'Given these circumstances, the current presidential election  now just days away  is bound to prove historic in more ways than one.', 'Maybe we will find that a president who is as good a campaigner as Uhuru Kenyatta is, can indeed break this longstanding jinx and get over 50 per cent of the vote in a reelection bid.', 'Or maybe we will realise that what really mattered all this time was for Uhuru to strategically break up the opposition coalition, NASA; and that the President effectively lost the election when he failed to find a way to do this.', 'Any fair assessment of how things stand at this point cannot fail to draw gloomy conclusions for Uhurus bid for reelection.', 'Uhuru is running on his development record. And one of the established eccentricities of Kenyan voters is that they rarely pay any attention to that kind of thing.', 'Kenyan presidential elections are very simply contests of us against them. And the key to victory is to ensure that we have a larger political coalition than them; and that we are united and they are not.', 'Beyond that, nothing else really matters.', 'No Kenyan president seeking reelection has yet faced an opposition as strong and as united as NASA. And there can be no denying that the President is in a tight corner.', 'But there is plenty of consolation for Uhuru in considering that virtually every Kenyan president has once or twice been in even tighter corners  and they have all the same gone on to win reelection.', 'The return to a multiparty political system in 1991 was widely celebrated as marking the end of the tyrannical Moi regime: yet Moi still went on to win two presidential elections.', 'Kibaki suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of his own Cabinet ministers (led by Raila) who opposed the draft constitution of the 2005 referendum. It seemed like it was the end of the road for Kibaki. But just two years later he was yet again sworn in as president.', 'So, strong as NASA undoubtedly is, it would be a mistake for its top leadership to underestimate Uhuru, even this late in the day.', '\n']"

Besides, the move will also curb the mushrooming of betting companies in Kenya. Speaking at the function, Kenya Premier League (KPL) chief executive officer, Jack Oguda, said they are looking to set up meeting with the President to to have the law rescinded or shelved all together.', ' We have lobby group among ourselvesfootball, rugby and boxing and we have been trying to set up meeting with the the Head of State to see what can be done aboutb the legislation, added Oguda.

', '\n', 'How should this be understood in terms of Chinas global positioning? And what are the implications of its expanding military footprint in Africa? ', '\n', 'The brief answer is that there has not been a sudden change in Chinas role and foreign policy profile on the continent. Instead, the change has been gradual and incremental. This is particularly evident from an international peacekeeping perspective.', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'Chinas role in Africa can be understood from three broad perspectives: to assert its position as a global power, craft a positive image of itself, and to promote its national interests.', '\n', 'A global player', '\n', 'China increasingly intends to show that it is a global power. The new base in Djibouti should be viewed in this context. Its in line with Chinas views on international peacekeeping. This is that peacekeeping is way of exerting greater influence on international affairs through the UN.', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'Secondly, Chinas expanding role in UN peacekeeping over the last two decades has helped it craft a more positive and constructive global image and reputation. It has used peacekeeping deliberately, and systematically, as a diplomatic instrument aimed at projecting China as a responsible global power. Its approach to peacekeeping has also allowed it to respond more quickly to African requests or challenges. And its worked as a confidence building measure with both African governments and the African Union.', '\n', '\n', 'But its growing involvement in peacekeeping has become more difficult to reconcile with its historical commitment to non-interventionism. This is particularly clear in the case of South Sudan. ', '\n', 'Strategic interests', '\n', 'Africas youngest nation has presented both challenges and opportunities for China. It has had to soften its historical arms length approach to facilitate a political solution to the ongoing conflict in South Sudan. But it has also needed to secure its strategic interests, especially the production of oil.', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'Chinas peacekeeping experience in South Sudan suggests that it tacitly recognises that some kind of intervention is sometimes needed to protect its strategic interests. ', '\n', 'Although Chinas involvement in peacekeeping in South Sudan should not be overstated in terms of its scope and extent, it does seem to signal the beginning of a far more assertive role in Africas peace and security issues.', '\n', 'At the same time, as much as China is being forced to adopt high risk strategies in cases of overseas investment, as in South Sudan, its approach can still be defined as being carefully impartial. It remains true that Chinas increased involvement in political dynamics in South Sudan doesnt sit easily with its long held policy of non-intervention.', '\n', 'A new colonialism?', '\n', 'Will Chinas presence in Africa  including its military footprint in Djibouti  turn into a new form of colonialism in Africa?', '\n', 'I believe this is highly unlikely. China remains acutely aware of the pitfalls associated with the politics of interventionism, especially in developing nations. It wants developing countries to regard it as a friend in global politics.', '\n', 'But it wouldnt be surprising if China started to apply at least a measure of military (hard) power alongside diplomatic (soft) power if it believes its economic interests are under threat.

If it fails, it is dissolved!', '\n', 'We have come nearly this close before, but it took the courage and the erudite reasoning Justice John Mativo to get firm orders and a deadline with consequences directed at Parliament.', '\n', 'The Supreme Court in 2012 was presented with a similar opportunity when the Attorney General requested an advisory opinion on whether the two-thirds gender rule applied to the 2013 general election. The top court dithered. In a majority decision, the top court told us the implementation of the two-thirds rule was progressive and  in the same breath  that the progressivity had a deadline, August 27, 2015. The opinion was a blow to what was a reasonably clear constitutional provision on empowerment of women, especially given a long history of political denigration that women have suffered.', '\n', 'But the then Chief Justice Dr Willy Mutungas contrary opinion was firm. Women had been made to wait for too long. They need wait no more, especially after all their struggles had delivered both Article 27, which required equal opportunities for men and women, and the unequivocal Article 81(b) that required at the minimum that Parliament be composed of at least one-thirds of the lesser represented gender. The chief justice ended by cautioning the courts should not allow Parliament, through its silence, to hold back rights that the Constitution had already conferred on women.', '\n', 'SUING PARLIAMENT', '\n', 'Back to Justice Mativo. But, before then, how did this case come about?', '\n', 'Following the Supreme Courts opinion, the AG and the then Commission for Implementation of the Constitution dragged their feet in proposing possible legislation. A testosterone-dominated Parliament was least interested. The Centre for Rights and Education Awareness saw this from afar and took the AG and the CIC to court. In early 2016, Justice Mumbi Ngugi found that both the AG and the CIC were in dereliction of duty by failing to present to Parliament draft legislation to implement the two-thirds gender rule. But this was not sufficient warning for Parliament. Half-heartedly, and seemingly with a clear intent at sabotage, Parliament attempted a constitutional amendment. During some sessions hardly any parliamentarian turned up to vote, though two-thirds of them were needed to approve the amendment. Worse, neither the leader of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy, nor the President cared much to mobilise their parliamentary troops. It did not really matter: They assumed women would vote for them anyway.', '\n', 'Come September 2016, and despite a choreographed one-year extension, Parliament still had the two-thirds business on its legislative back burner, not steaming but just there. Cold, forgotten. CREAW, CRAWN-Trust and the Kenya National Commission for Human Rights sued.', '\n', 'HOW BASIC THIS ALL IS', '\n', 'Justice Mativos judgment is straightforward. The Constitution required Parliament to pass a law to guarantee that not more than two-thirds of MPs were of the same gender. The Supreme Court said that the law must be passed by August 27, 2015. Instead, Parliament gave itself an extension to August, 2016  something the Constitution allowed. But it still did not pass the law.', '\n', 'And what was most offensive, in its defence, Parliament tried to delay the matter and rely on technicalities to escape responsibility, instead of directing all its energies to addressing the question of the two-thirds constitutional imperative that was before court.', '\n', 'Then Judge Mativo did a lot of educating. The Constitution is supreme. Parliament is not. Parliament is subject to the Constitution, so too are the courts. And one way that courts serve the Constitution is by vigilantly pronouncing themselves when anyone, including Parliament, contravenes the Constitution. ', '\n', 'But what inspired Justice Mativos approach: Perhaps the one line of the judgment that will stay with me for a very long time  equality of rights under the law for all persons, male or female, is so basic to democracy and commitment to human rights. Such a basic finding, yet so fundamental.', '\n', 'DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT', '\n', 'Those who wrote our Constitution were alert to the ways of our parliamentarians. They knew that deadlines to enact laws would not alone force Parliaments, often overwhelmed with delusions of grandeur, to enact all the laws needed to implement the Constitution. So they added Article 261 in the Constitution.', '\n', 'This says that if parliamentarians fail to enact a law required to implement the Constitution within the stipulated timeline, they can extend the period by a year  once. If ultimately they dont pass the law, anyone can complain to the High Court, which, if it finds Parliament in default, may impose a timeframe within which to pass the law. And, if Parliament does not honour the courts deadline, then anyone  and here it is anyone  can notify the Chief Justice of Parliaments failure. Here is where it hurts  the Chief Justice shall advise the President to dissolve Parliament and the President shall [means must] dissolve Parliament. The two shalls are not platitudes; neither Chief Justice nor President has an out from his respective shall.', '\n', 'A MURKY SITUATION BORN OF PARLIAMENTARY MISCHIEF', '\n', 'What next for Parliament? The parliamentarians may have anticipated that the judge would order dissolution if they failed to pass the legislation. Anyway, it is plainly there in the Constitution for those parliamentarians who can, and choose to, read it. I bet they all never saw one thing coming  the type of law the court would require them to pass. Because of the short timelines imposed by Justice Mativo, that law can only be statutory not a constitutional amendment (because the latter takes over three months). (Male) MPs preferred no change, but their second choice was to amend the Constitution to introduce women top-up seats in Parliament. But this is not an option now.', '\n', 'History is important here. In 2011, the Kenya Law Reform Commission and the Interim Independent Electoral Commission proposed in the draft Elections Bill how a simple formula to achieve the two-thirds in Parliament Cluster constituencies into fours and in each election cycle designate one from each cluster to have only women candidates contesting. Over four general elections all the 290 constituencies, save two, would have gone through this cycle.', '\n', 'Men hit the roof, not least our then male-dominated Cabinet. The proposal was unceremoniously dropped based on warped logic (if logic is the right word). This was their hue and cry: How do you convince a man who has resolved to run in a particular constituency that this is a woman-candidate only constituency. Some were blunter, If Baba wants to run in Kibra, how do you now tell Baba this election cycle Kibra is a woman-candidate only constituency. Or where do you start from if you have to tell one Uhuru Kenyatta, son of Jomo, that he cannot run in Gatundu South. How? My friend, hizi viti zina wenyewe!', '\n', 'But, ridiculous as it may sound, this formula is constitutional.', '\n', 'NOW WE SIT AND WATCH', '\n', 'True affirmative action means that those who have spent lifetimes perched on others shoulders have to climb down and offer their shoulders to be trampled upon too. This is what the legislation to enforce the two-thirds gender rule will demand. It is the time for patriarchy to yield, at least to some extent. If however our parliamentarians decide to be adamant about disobeying the Court, they better be ready to be consumed by the unrelenting wave of a transformative Constitution. The scenario demands a front row seat to watch what unfolds next.', '\n']"

This should be an atmosphere of friendship and collaboration, openness and honesty. All judgement of new ideas must be suspended (until evaluation stage).

It was politically instigated violence in the small nation between the two main communities  Tutsi and Hutu - that was so intense, in 100 days close to one million people were killed.', ' ', 'However, the genocide did not just happen. It was caused by careless ethnic vitriol and political utterances by the then Rwandan political and military leadership. It was also caused by the inability of other Rwandans to aggressively challenge these utterances and statements in time. Finally, it happened because of inaction of Rwandan legal institutions on obvious acts of criminal incitement.', ' ', 'In Kenya after the 2007 general election we nearly went the Rwandan way. As a religious person would say, it was by the Grace of God that we did not. However 1,200 Kenyans still died and the country lost billions of shillings from its economy. The causes were the same. Politically instigated violence based on inter-ethnic incitement. Again, the inability of other Kenyans to aggressively challenge those making these utterances and the inaction by Kenyan legal institutions at the time got us to that point.', ' ', 'However, because we had an internal conversation, we realised that the catalyst to the violence was an inadequacy within the institutions mandated to handle elections, and solve any related disputes. In 2010 we promulgated a new Constitution that has dealt with these and many other issues around how Kenyans relate to each other, and to the state. The Constitution is touted as one of the most advanced in the world.', ' ', 'We now have the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission as the only institution that can announce election results.

However, we are facing a real possibility of retrogressing to where we were before 2007; or where Rwanda was before April 1994. This is mainly because unlike President Uhuru Kenyatta who has publicly declared, unconditionally, that he will concede defeat should Kenyans vote for someone else, Raila Odinga  the main opposition presidential candidate now and in 2007 - has declared he will not accept IEBC results if they do not agree with the results of his own private tallying centre.

If he believes the results are not correct, he will then determine the next course of action, but it will not be the legal course of going to court. The words Kenya will burn have been used quite liberally by his team. Clearly, we might need to prepare for the possibility of election-related violence, at least in some areas in the country  unless we do something about it.', ' ', 'First, I think we need to all declare that a political conflict between two individuals, or two political parties, cannot be used to justify violent upheaval for 45 million Kenyans. Kenyans from all walks of life, local and international NGOs, and the international political community must insist that any such conflict must be taken to court. Period!', ' ', 'Second, we must start pointing fingers at those we will hold politically and/or criminally responsible should there be any death, loss or destruction this August due to election-related violence.

', '\n', 'The brief answer is that there has not been a sudden change in Chinas role and foreign policy profile on the continent. Instead, the change has been gradual and incremental. This is particularly evident from an international peacekeeping perspective.', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'Chinas role in Africa can be understood from three broad perspectives: to assert its position as a global power, craft a positive image of itself, and to promote its national interests.', '\n', 'A global player', '\n', 'China increasingly intends to show that it is a global power. The new base in Djibouti should be viewed in this context. Its in line with Chinas views on international peacekeeping. This is that peacekeeping is way of exerting greater influence on international affairs through the UN.', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'Secondly, Chinas expanding role in UN peacekeeping over the last two decades has helped it craft a more positive and constructive global image and reputation. It has used peacekeeping deliberately, and systematically, as a diplomatic instrument aimed at projecting China as a responsible global power.

If it fails, it is dissolved!', '\n', 'We have come nearly this close before, but it took the courage and the erudite reasoning Justice John Mativo to get firm orders and a deadline with consequences directed at Parliament.', '\n', 'The Supreme Court in 2012 was presented with a similar opportunity when the Attorney General requested an advisory opinion on whether the two-thirds gender rule applied to the 2013 general election. The top court dithered. In a majority decision, the top court told us the implementation of the two-thirds rule was progressive and  in the same breath  that the progressivity had a deadline, August 27, 2015. The opinion was a blow to what was a reasonably clear constitutional provision on empowerment of women, especially given a long history of political denigration that women have suffered.', '\n', 'But the then Chief Justice Dr Willy Mutungas contrary opinion was firm. Women had been made to wait for too long. They need wait no more, especially after all their struggles had delivered both Article 27, which required equal opportunities for men and women, and the unequivocal Article 81(b) that required at the minimum that Parliament be composed of at least one-thirds of the lesser represented gender. The chief justice ended by cautioning the courts should not allow Parliament, through its silence, to hold back rights that the Constitution had already conferred on women.', '\n', 'SUING PARLIAMENT', '\n', 'Back to Justice Mativo. But, before then, how did this case come about?', '\n', 'Following the Supreme Courts opinion, the AG and the then Commission for Implementation of the Constitution dragged their feet in proposing possible legislation. A testosterone-dominated Parliament was least interested. The Centre for Rights and Education Awareness saw this from afar and took the AG and the CIC to court. In early 2016, Justice Mumbi Ngugi found that both the AG and the CIC were in dereliction of duty by failing to present to Parliament draft legislation to implement the two-thirds gender rule. But this was not sufficient warning for Parliament. Half-heartedly, and seemingly with a clear intent at sabotage, Parliament attempted a constitutional amendment. During some sessions hardly any parliamentarian turned up to vote, though two-thirds of them were needed to approve the amendment. Worse, neither the leader of the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy, nor the President cared much to mobilise their parliamentary troops. It did not really matter: They assumed women would vote for them anyway.', '\n', 'Come September 2016, and despite a choreographed one-year extension, Parliament still had the two-thirds business on its legislative back burner, not steaming but just there. Cold, forgotten. CREAW, CRAWN-Trust and the Kenya National Commission for Human Rights sued.', '\n', 'HOW BASIC THIS ALL IS', '\n', 'Justice Mativos judgment is straightforward. The Constitution required Parliament to pass a law to guarantee that not more than two-thirds of MPs were of the same gender. The Supreme Court said that the law must be passed by August 27, 2015. Instead, Parliament gave itself an extension to August, 2016  something the Constitution allowed. But it still did not pass the law.', '\n', 'And what was most offensive, in its defence, Parliament tried to delay the matter and rely on technicalities to escape responsibility, instead of directing all its energies to addressing the question of the two-thirds constitutional imperative that was before court.', '\n', 'Then Judge Mativo did a lot of educating. The Constitution is supreme. Parliament is not. Parliament is subject to the Constitution, so too are the courts. And one way that courts serve the Constitution is by vigilantly pronouncing themselves when anyone, including Parliament, contravenes the Constitution. ', '\n', 'But what inspired Justice Mativos approach: Perhaps the one line of the judgment that will stay with me for a very long time  equality of rights under the law for all persons, male or female, is so basic to democracy and commitment to human rights. Such a basic finding, yet so fundamental.', '\n', 'DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT', '\n', 'Those who wrote our Constitution were alert to the ways of our parliamentarians. They knew that deadlines to enact laws would not alone force Parliaments, often overwhelmed with delusions of grandeur, to enact all the laws needed to implement the Constitution. So they added Article 261 in the Constitution.', '\n', 'This says that if parliamentarians fail to enact a law required to implement the Constitution within the stipulated timeline, they can extend the period by a year  once. If ultimately they dont pass the law, anyone can complain to the High Court, which, if it finds Parliament in default, may impose a timeframe within which to pass the law. And, if Parliament does not honour the courts deadline, then anyone  and here it is anyone  can notify the Chief Justice of Parliaments failure. Here is where it hurts  the Chief Justice shall advise the President to dissolve Parliament and the President shall [means must] dissolve Parliament. The two shalls are not platitudes; neither Chief Justice nor President has an out from his respective shall.', '\n', 'A MURKY SITUATION BORN OF PARLIAMENTARY MISCHIEF', '\n', 'What next for Parliament? The parliamentarians may have anticipated that the judge would order dissolution if they failed to pass the legislation. Anyway, it is plainly there in the Constitution for those parliamentarians who can, and choose to, read it. I bet they all never saw one thing coming  the type of law the court would require them to pass. Because of the short timelines imposed by Justice Mativo, that law can only be statutory not a constitutional amendment (because the latter takes over three months). (Male) MPs preferred no change, but their second choice was to amend the Constitution to introduce women top-up seats in Parliament. But this is not an option now.', '\n', 'History is important here. In 2011, the Kenya Law Reform Commission and the Interim Independent Electoral Commission proposed in the draft Elections Bill how a simple formula to achieve the two-thirds in Parliament Cluster constituencies into fours and in each election cycle designate one from each cluster to have only women candidates contesting. Over four general elections all the 290 constituencies, save two, would have gone through this cycle.', '\n', 'Men hit the roof, not least our then male-dominated Cabinet. The proposal was unceremoniously dropped based on warped logic (if logic is the right word).
