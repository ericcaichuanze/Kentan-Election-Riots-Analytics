At the same time, traditional official\nsources are limited, and unlikely to increase dramatically in the coming\nyears.

The implication is that a mix of aid,\ndomestic government resources and private sector capital is needed to achieve\nresults. ', ' ', 'The key strength of DFIs is the\nability to catalyze investment in the private sector beyond their own resources,\nand therefore fill in the resource gap. This is important, because it is now\nwell understand that economic growth will come from the private sector.

To be more effective, DFIs\nneed to evolve and expand their capabilities to respond to emerging policy\ngoals. On the other hand, policymakers\nneed to understand how and where DFIs need to be deployed. ', ' ', 'Four areas are key to successful\ndeployment of DFIs. One, a higher risk tolerance.

Three, the need to deploy more\nresources in form of finances and staff, in order to play a larger role and\ntake on new tasks. Four, improvement in ability to disseminate lessons learnt\nand to measure impact.', ' ', 'As the policy landscape is changing\nto put more emphasis on private sector investment, jobs and growth, DFIs have a\nunique and strategic role to play.

Sometimes profit centres are derived from expenses by managing expenses, such as maintenance, travel, all those sorts of things.', ' ', 'And again, looking at the base revenue, to increase revenue, what this governor has done is to increase licence fees, punishing businesses rather than allowing them to grow so he can derive more revenue. He is doing the opposite. He is looking at things in a short-term way. Revenue authorities all over the world try to increase the base.

They occupy huge chunks of land yet on just five acres, if you just did five high-rise flats, you could actually accommodate them and you will be left with lots of land, which would allow you to build more flats and probably resettle people who live in the slums.', ' ', 'The issue that has always arisen is, at what cost? The current county government, because they are not pro-people and they are for commercial ventures, are proposing to do the same at a cost that the current inhabitants of those estates cannot afford. That is what we would reverse. We would want to actually build flats for those people for free or at minimum costs, same as what they are paying to the county government today.', ' ', 'How will you help micro and small businesses?

If you apply for a licence, if you want to do business, this is what it takes so that it is predictable. You know business thrives in a predictable environment. If you want to build flats out there, you have to know you will get this approval within these number of days. That is the predictability I want to create.', ' ', 'Security is not a devolved function, but what would you do to improve the security of the city to attract investors and make businesses grow?', ' ', ""The most important thing is to have a situation where the two levels of governments collaborate and work well.

What will you do differently?', ' ', 'The governor talks too much and does very little. He only talks when there is a disaster. If you mark a building for demolition for safety, you have to make sure it is demolished. Even if the owner goes to court, you will have enough evidence to show the danger. Remember, courts only favour the national good not the individual good. In my devolution plan, I want physical planners in every constituency, so that we can arrest the situation early enough. At the moment, we capture the situation after the event, when already damage and loss of life has occurred. But if we have physical planners in every constituency, then you capture every building that is coming up, instead of waiting for officers in City Hall to go and inspect.', ' ', 'The number of street urchins in Nairobi has grown really fast in the last four years. How do you intend to get rid of them?', ' ', 'Unemployment is high. We will create a conducive business environment so local and foreign investors can invest in Nairobi to create jobs. And in our devolution, we will have a new market in every constituency so our informal sector can have a better place to trade in.', ' ', 'Most young people on the streets are highly talented. We want to ensure we have talent centres, whether it is in sports or arts, so they can develop their talents and gain from them. This will reduce the number of people going to the streets. But remember, the defunct city council had rehabilitation centres for street children. And kids went to them and eventually got into schools. And stories have been written about CEOs who were on the streets but went to school through rehabilitation. So rehabilitation is very important and we have to go through it. Remember under Narc administration, this had started, but when devolution came, it died.', ' ', 'Your opponents, especially Miguna Miguna, have accused you of mismanaging the firms you have previously managed. How do you respond to these allegations?', ' ', 'I dare you to ask Miguna to table any iota of evidence. Yapping in press conferences and in TV analyses is farther from the truth. If he is honest enough, if he is a man enough, let him table what he yaps. I have had an impeccable tenure of service to the nation in my time as MD, as CEO of a big reinsurance company, as chairman of KFF, as an assistant minister and as an MP.

I think, the right people to do the polls are the voters themselves. This is the first election where you have more independent candidates than the two bigger parties put together. It is a confirmation that the nominations of the two parties were a sham and that this is the first time and a big danger in the history of political parties that if they get their act well, in future nobody will take part in the primaries. People will just go independently because primaries have proven to be a waste of time. However, the most important thing is that Nairobians have a choice.

And they have a choice between the bad, the ugly and the good.', ' ', 'Some Jubilee politicians say Peter Kenneth is a man out to divide votes and deny Sonko victory.', ' ', 'People who will vote for me would never vote for that particular candidate.
