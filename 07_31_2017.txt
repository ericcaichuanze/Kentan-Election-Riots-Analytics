A vehicle belonging to the missing IEBC's ICT deputy director Chris Musando has been traced at TRM parking lot in Nairobi.

The Land Rover Discovery was found intact at Thika road Mall at 1 am on Monday.

Nairobi DCI Chief Ireri Kamwende said the vehicle was intact and the search for the senior officer has been intensified.

The commission's chairman Wafula Chebukati said Musando was last seen on Friday night.

"The last communication from him is an SMS sent to one of his colleagues at around 3 am on Saturday morning," Chebukati said.

He added the content of the SMS suggested Musando was conscious and fully aware of his itinerary for the day.

"The matter has been reported to police and the commission, together with family members, is working closely with them to establish his whereabouts."


Musando was filling in for IEBC director of ICT James Muhati who was sent on a 30-day compulsory leave for not cooperating with the audit department.

Muhati was dismissed after a report by the Audit, Risk and Compliance department.

"He failed to cooperate in the provision of information requested from the department contrary to the public, finance and management regulations 2015," communications manager Andrew Limo said in a statement.

Musando was involved in the management of the KIEMS for voter registration, voter identification and results transmission.

Sources close to the commission said he helped seal loopholes that might be associated with BVR kits.

Security agencies have revealed the identity of the intruder at DP William Ruto's Sugoi home last Saturday.

CID boss Ndegwa Muhoro said on Monday the suspect who was killed on Sunday at the home is Mohammed Ibrahim Muhamood.

Muhoro says Muhamood was a resident of Dandu village in Mandera East.

He said they are yet to establish terror links in the attack, adding that Muhamood acted alone.

Meanwhile, the court has granted anti-terror police to hold another suspect for 20 days to pave way for further investigations on his links with the slain suspect.

Abdikadir Abdullahi Abdi is in detention on the basis that he was harbouring Muhamood in his house some 20km away from Ruto's home.


Initial reports indicated that four gunmen attacked the Deputy President's home.

It later emerged that a GSU officer manning the gate was accosted by a lone machete wielding attacker.

According to Boinett, the "intruder" hit the officer severally before gaining access to the home.

He added that the suspect was later forced to hide at a building under construction after reinforcement was called, leading to an overnight security operation at the home.Kenya’s Purity Rionoripo and Ethiopia’s Tadese Tola took the honours at the Bogota Half Marathon, an IAAF Gold Label Road Race, in two races that could hardly have been more contrasting yesterday.
Rionoripo posted the second fastest women’s winning time in the history of the race when she crossed the line in 1:11:56, winning by almost two minutes.
Rionoripo, the 2009 world U-18 3000m champion, broke away seven kilometres into the race and seemed immune to the adverse conditions as she powered away from her rivals before winning in a time only superseded by the outstanding course record of 1:10:29 set by her compatriot Susan Chepkemei in 2003.
“It was very difficult to win. I was just thinking about finishing the race. The height of Bogota was the most difficult for me. I’m very happy because Tadese Tola did not reach me, I did not let him reach me,” reflected Rionoripo, with the women’s elite runners starting 10 minutes before the men.
Fellow Kenya’s Veronica Nyaruai, the 2005 world U-18 3000m champion, finished a distant second in 1:13:41. Ethiopia’s defending champion Amane Gobena, from whom much was expected after her personal best of 2:21:51 when finishing second in the Tokyo Marathon in February, was second for much of the race but struggled in the final two kilometres and was passed by Nyaraui before finishing third in 1:14:11.
By contrast, Tola, the 2013 world championships marathon bronze medallist, broke away from three Kenyan rivals—Kiprop Limo, Kimutai Kiplimo and Mariu Kipserem —nine kilometres into the race.
Kipserem got back on level terms with Tola in the 13th kilometre as the Ethiopian eased back on the pace and the pair ran relatively easily shoulder-to-shoulder for the next four kilometres until Tola surged again. This time there was no return for Kipserem as Tola—running his first international race since finishing second in Bogota 12 months —gradually forged a winning lead, crossing the line in 1:05:16 with Kipserem coming home 15 seconds later.
“I felt very strong throughout the race and it was a good competition for me, but the wind did not help much and certainly made it difficult to run fast times,” reflected Tola, who ended a five-year winning streak by Kenyan men at the race and became just the second Ethiopian winner in the 17-year history of the event.
Limo finished a distant third in 1:06:19 while getting a rousing welcome at the finish line in the Parque Simon Bolivar, the first local runner home was the 42-year-old Colombian international Diego Colorado, who finished sixth in 1:07:40.
Tola’s winning time was the slowest in the history of the race, the modest times being a combination of Bogota’s altitude – some of the Colombian capital lies at around 2600 metres and the slightly undulating course has a high point of 2445 metres— temperatures that peaked at around 21 degrees Celsius, stiff breezes but mainly the unwillingness of the Kenyan contingent to push the pace and challenge Tola.
Marathon world record holder Dennis Kimetto dropped out early in the race with a recurrence of a groin strain above his right thigh, which he first suffered after a recent fall in Kenya. More than 40,000 runner participated in the half marathon and associated 10km race on Sunday morning.Purity Rionoripo. /COURTESY

Speaking at Kairuri Stadium, Embu North subcounty, during a campaign rally, he said NASA is not ready for the August 8 polls and its leaders are trying all ways to cause chaos so that they can negotiate for a grand coalition government.

Kenyatta said he’s privy to the alliance’s ulterior motives, and will ensure Kenyans go to the polls to elect their leaders.

He said NASA cannot intimidate the government by dragging the military into their falsehoods. Uhuru pledged he will protect the Constitution and make use of all state apparatus necessary to ensure the safety of Kenyans.

Uhuru was accompanied by DP William Ruto, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi, Jubilee candidates, and those from other parties friendly to the ruling party. He said he will ensure the election is conducted as stipulated in the law.

“I swore to protect the Constitution and I will do it by ensuring the election is conducted on August 8. I am also a Christian and therefore I can’t promise that I will protect the law and then I violate it,” Uhuru said.

He asked the Opposition to focus on wooing voters instead of causing tension to grab power through the back door.


Only Governor Martin Wambora, former Cooperative Minister Njeru Ndwiga, Jubilee’s woman representative Jane Wanjuki and Manyatta MP John Muchiri were asked to address the crowd. Some were shouted down.

Kenyatta and Ruto enumerated their achievements in the whole country and in the county since they came into office four years ago. They cited a 100km ring road that is being tarmacked, Last Mile Connectivity project, the SGR, free maternity services, and scrapping of national exams fees, among others.

Uhuru vowed to deal with leaders of cooperative societies who have stolen farmers’ funds, especially in the coffee sector.

He promised to have the Kairuri-Kiriari roads tarmacked soon.

Before Uhuru’s arrival, there was a showdown between various political parties supporting his reelection, with each trying to outdo the other.

During the vote-hunt tour, the President was accompanied by governor candidates Kithinji Kiragu of PNU, Senator Lenny Kivuti (Maendeleo Chap Chap) and Jubilee’s Wambora.

Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki, Kanu woman rep candidate Susan Nyaga and Embu Woman rep Rose Mitaru were also on the campaign trail.DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro addresses the media in Eldoret town on Monday, July 31, 2017. /MATHEWS NDANYI

Chris Musando's killers will be brought to justice, DCI boss Ndegwa Muhoro has said while calling for calm.

The IEBC acting ICT director was found dead in Kikuyu and his body taken to City Mortuary on Saturday.

Musando's family members have identified the body and are at the facility.

He was reported missing on Friday, and a vehicle belonging to him was later found at TRM.

"We are speculating a lot and pointing fingers to the wrong direction but we have professional investigators who are following up all leads to unravel the killing," Muhoro said in Eldoret.

IG Joseph Boinnet said a Special DCI Homicide Team has been put together to look into the matter.

"We shall be providing further updates on the status of the investigations within the next few days," he said in a statement on Monday.

UK and US to assist in probe

The United Kingdom and United States have offered assistance in investigations on Musando's torture and murder.

"It is critical that Kenya have free, fair credible and peaceful elections," the countries said in a joint statement.

Politicians have said the murder is a bad sign of the credibility of the August 8 polls.

Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju termed the incident unfortunate and asked for speedy investigations.

"We ask politicians to let security agencies do their work to its conclusion. Let us not cloud this death because no one deserves to die because of politics," he said in a statement in Monday.

Mombasa governor candidate Hassan Omar condemned Musando's death, saying it is a show of the extent politicians are willing to go to get their way.


"Is it because there is something that he refused to bulge into? Are they trying to get rid of the person who most likely would understand the integrity of the system in terms of a credible election?” he said on Monday.

Omar described his death as ‘murder most foul’.

“It demonstrates the high stakes and the extent some candidates or some political parties or coalitions or formations could go,” said Omar.

CCM leader Isaac Rutto said investigations should be handled seriously.

"We want to imagine that the murder of the ICT manager is not related with the election," he said.

MP Zakayo Cheruiyot demanded an explanation on the death, saying it is an attempt to disrupt the general election that is in seven days.

As he sent condolences to Musando's family, the MP called for investigations so those responsible face the law.

Presidential candidate Joe Nyaga said the death brought bad memories of the 2007 general election.

He said the death, one week to the general election, may trigger post-poll violence.

"We need the police and the IEBC to get to the bottom of the matter. We believe this is in bad taste," he said during campaigns in Awendo.

He asked attendants to observe a minute of silence for the slain official.

Musando was one of the few people with knowledge on the whereabouts of the servers at IEBC.

The manager had given Central police station officers reports of death threats.

The IEBC postponed testing of election results transmission following Musando’s murder. The commission was to test the transmission from 3pm at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi and the 47 centres in counties.

IEBC has received the first batch of presidential ballot papers.

Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the 192 units are for 30 counties, which will be confirmed on Tuesday.

Another batch will land on Tuesday, while the final batch is expected on Wednesday. The general election is seven days away.

Chebukati said they will carry out a simulation of the results transmission system on Wednesday at 3pm.

The exercise was postponed following the murder of ICT data centre manager Chris Msando.

Msando was reported missing on Friday and was found dead in Kikuyu on Saturday.

Before this, his vehicle was found near TRM on Thika Superhighway.


"The commission is cognisant of the sensitivity around the death and appeals to the political class to work towards a stable political environment," the chair said in a statement.

More on this: Chris Msando's killers will face the law, DCI assures

Over the recent weeks there was concern that the presidential ballot papers may not be ready in time for the August 8 polls,

This is after the NASA coalition went to court seeking to halt printing of presidential ballot papers by Al Ghurair printing firm.

The Opposition claimed the Dubai-based firm had links with President Uhuru Kenyatta.

The Constitution of Kenya 2010 provides for the equality and non-discrimination principle to ensure that women and men have a right to equal treatment, including the right to equal opportunities in political, economic, cultural and social spheres.

Direct and indirect discrimination is forbidden based on grounds including race, sex, pregnancy, marital status, health status, ethnic or social origin, colour, age, disability, religion conscience, belief, culture, dress, language or birth.

Further, the constitution seeks that the state will take legislative and other measures, including affirmative action programmes, and policies designed to redress the disadvantage suffered by individuals or groups in the past.

The “not more than two-thirds gender rule” is established to ensure that in appointive and elective positions, not more than two thirds of members in any on public body can be of the same gender.

Since Independence, Parliament has been male-dominated. The 11th parliament registered the highest numbers ever of women at 19.7 per cent for the National Assembly and 26 per cent for the Senate, all courtesy of the new constitutional dispensation. The female representation in Parliament has risen from 1.2 per cent in 1967 to 10 per cent in 2007, with very few women elected on competitive elective positions. The numbers of women in other public leadership positions has also remained very low over the years.

Kenya has had poor women representation in Parliament. Young women, women with disabilities and those from marginalised and minority communities are more vulnerable to political underrepresentation.

For instance, in the 2013 election, out of 290 constituency seats available for men and women to compete, only 16 women were elected. In the Senate, no woman was elected. Similar situation was seen for the gubernatorial seats. At the county assemblies, out of 1,450 seats available, only 86 women were elected and over 740 women were nominated, courtesy of the two-thirds gender rule, which calls for nominating from party lists the number of special seat members necessary to ensure that no more than two-thirds of the membership of the assembly are of the same gender. That consideration should be given to marginalised groups, including persons with disability and the youth, as provided in the Elections Act.

The National Gender and Equality Commission is a constitutional body established to ensure compliance with the equality and inclusion principles. The NGEC monitored the election process in 2013 and is currently monitoring the process towards the August 8 general election.

The following stands out as key challenges to women participation in elective positions: Cultural barriers, financial constraints, gender-based violence, coping with the dual women roles, biases and stereotypes.


In the upcoming election, women have registered very low numbers of aspirants as compared to men. Firstly, there is no female presidential candidate nor running mate. While there are 202 male aspirants for gubernatorial seats, there are only nine women for the same. Some 256 men are running for senatorial seats, with only 20 women. At the parliamentary level, only 131 women are cleared, as compared to 1,761 men. The county assembly level has registered the highest female competitors at 31.6 per cent. These are 900 women against 10,957 men. On average, only 28.8 per cent of women are in the race.

To help women participate in political life on equal basis with men, Kenya has taken several measures, including the gender quotas provided for by the constitution and economic empowerment through the Women Enterprise Fund.

The country should embrace the changing gender roles of men and women. We need to educate men and women, boys and girls to appreciate the role played by both genders in development. Education will help society to appreciate the dual gender roles and the need to balance. We need to remove the role biases and profile men and women, boys and girls as leaders. Currently, most women are bread winners and heading families. We can replicate the same in leadership at other levels beyond the family.

Communities require education to recognise harmful cultural practices that undermine gender roles and shun them.

Women should not be discriminated against for being women. Gender-based violence is a violation of women’s rights. All violators must be prosecuted and justice given to the women and girls.

Lastly, women when threatened become fearful. We need to guarantee the women vying and participating in the 2017 election security. All Kenyans need to be safe to have a peaceful election.

Governor Kenneth Lusaka (Jubilee) and Ford Kenya nominee Wycliffe Wangamati had attended the funeral of slain businessman Edward Juma, a Jubilee campaigner, at Chebukwabi Primary School in Kimilili. Water CS Eugene Wamalwa was also at the funeral.

Juma was killed last week by unknown gunmen.

Lusaka and Wangamati’s supporters fought, disrupting the funeral.

While the sermon was ongoing, Wangamati’s team arrived with NASA music blaring. And as they were looking for places to sit, angry Lusaka supporters landed on them with kicks and blows, claiming they have no respect for the dead and the church.

The Ford Kenya team fled and the family hurriedly buried the body.


While Wangamati’s group was leaving the school compound, they were again attacked by Jubilee supporters.

Former Kimilili MP aspirant Chirasha Wakoli Makanda suffered a broken arm and his car was destroyed, while former Chwele-Kabuchai MCA aspirant Simiyu Mutaki was beaten up and suffered injuries all over the body.

Lusaka and Wangamati reported the incidents at Kimilili police station. They blamed each other for the chaos.

This is the second time the two camps have clashed. They first clashed in Bungoma town on June 2 while heading for rallies after being cleared by the IEBC. A woman was shot and killed by a stray bullet as police tried to quell the chaos.

The two politicians were fined Sh1 million each by the IEBC Disciplinary Committee and asked to refrain from incidents that could cause violence and loss of lives.Jubilee Party supporters listen to President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto during their campaigns in Migori county, July 28, 2017. /PSCU

President Uhuru Kenyatta ignored Migori Senator Wilfred Machage’s call and asked the Kuria community to vote for Jubilee Party candidates.

Uhuru and DP William Ruto were on a vote-hunt tour of the Nyamira area on Friday.

Machage last Monday warned Uhuru against endorsing JP candidates. He was elected on the ODM ticket in 2013 but defected to his former party, DP, which is affiliated to Jubilee, to run for the Kuria West parliamentary seat. Incumbent Mathias Robi is running on Jubilee.


Machage has insisted Kurias will vote for Uhuru, but are free to choose candidates from other parties in the remaining five seats.

The Kuria West battle is a two-horse race between Machage and Robi, both who both enjoy massive support from their Abakira and Abairege clans.

Governor Patrick Khaemba should not take credit for the President's allocation of prison land for Kitale's expansion, a Jubilee politician has said.

Kakai Bissau said at the weekend that it is he and Water CS Eugene Wamalwa who fought for the 159 acres of Kitale prison property in Trans Nzoia county.

"Governor Khaemba should not lie that he fought for the land. It was through my efforts and those of CS Eugene that the land was issued to the county government."

During his tour of the county on Saturday, President Uhuru Kenyatta drummed up support for Bissau, Janet Nangabo (woman representative) and Michael Mbito (Senator).

Uhuru said they are the best candidates to oversee and complete projects initiated by the Jubilee government in the county.

"I have ordered that the land be transferred to the county government but on 8 August you should come out in large number to elect Bissau as your governor...He will ensure development projects are accomplished."

More on this: UhuRuto in Trans Nzoia: Kitale prison to give 159 acres for town's expansion

Khaemba had accused Wamalwa of sabotaging county development by denying him prison land for the expansion of Kitale town.

During the launch of campaigns by Jubilee governor candidate Maurice Kakai Bissau months ago, the CS allegedly said the land would only be given after Jubilee candidates win the election.


Khaemba thanked the President for assigning the land saying this will ensure decongestion and guarantee economic growth.

The decision followed three years of talks between the prison department and the county which had requested 1,000 acres.

"I am happy to note that our request to the President and the engagement have borne fruits," he told a press briefing on Sunday, noting they will make good use of the land.

"We will establish modern zones for retail, wholesale, the light industry, transport, recreation, office and residential projects," he said.

The county boss further noted that his government is pursuing 400 acres from Kenya Forest Service land, 50 from Kenya Railways Cooperation, 200 from Agriculture Development Corporation and 30 from African Inland Church.

"This land will be used for expansion of the town and setting up of a major retail and wholesale center."

The Governor said ADC and AIC land will be used for an industrial park, a university and expansion of Kitale Airstrip.

He added the county has so far acquired 30 acres of land across its 25 wards and set up dispensaries, a market and roads.

Anti-terror police have detained a man who allegedly housed the lone ranger who attacked DP William Ruto's home at the weekend.

Abdikadir Abdullahi will be in police custody for 20 days, as directed by Eldoret chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa.

This will facilitate investigations into the 18-hour attack that took place on Saturday and left the invader dead.

More on this: [VIDEO] Ruto home intruder killed after night of heavy gunfire, explosions

Abdullahi, who was taken to court on Monday, said he does not know the unidentified attacker and denied having links to him.

Detectives said they needed time to collect his fingerprints and analyse mobile phone records and other information in Nairobi.

“The court has allowed the application to detain him at Kenya Railways police station in Eldoret for investigations to be completed," said Obulutsa.

Abdullahi told the court he was beaten and injured by a mob at Jua Kali market about 20 kilometers from the DP’s home in Sugoi, Eldoret.


“They just pounced on me, and beat me up, claiming I knew him but for sure I don’t know him and I have no links to him. It’s only that we are both of Somali origin."

Obulutsa said he only operates his business in Jua Kali.

He protested when journalists took photographs of him, saying he is innocent and should not be exposed in this manner.

But the magistrate gave the media permission saying the matter is of great public concern and must be investigated thoroughly.

Police earlier collected the fingerprints of the invader and will take the samples for examination in the capital to establish his identity.

They have confirmed the man had been selling his merchandise at Jua Kali market for several months, Eldoret West Police boss Samuel Mutunga said on Monday.

The government has disbursed Sh12 billon under the Youth Enterprise Fund.

Fund CEO Josiah Moriasi urged youths to take loans and set up businesses.

“Initially youths were required to be in a group of 12 members, today we only require them to be five to qualify for a loan,” he said.

The government has increased the minimum loan from Sh50,000 to Sh100,000.

Moriasi was speaking during a youth empowerment programme in Kitale

He said youth who borrow Sh100,000 loans will also qualify for Sh25,000 each, so in total they will take home Sh250,000.


Once they take the loans, beneficiaries will be required to pay five per cent management fee. The loans are interest-free.

All that is required to qualify for a loan is a registration certificate.

Packages on offer include the Talanta loan, which is given to youths to nurture their talents. The minimum is Sh300,000.

Also on offer are agribusiness loans to encourage youths to venture into farming. Youths can take up Sh2 million.

Moriasi said the government had opened more offices at the subcounties to process the loans.

Packages on offer include the Talanta loan, which is given to youths to nurture their talents. The minimum is Sh300,000.

Also on offer are agribusiness loans to encourage youths to venture into farming. Youths can take up Sh2 million.

Moriasi said the government had opened more offices at the subcounties to process the loans.

The government has disbursed Sh12 billon under the Youth Enterprise Fund.

Fund CEO Josiah Moriasi urged youths to take loans and set up businesses.

“Initially youths were required to be in a group of 12 members, today we only require them to be five to qualify for a loan,” he said.

The government has increased the minimum loan from Sh50,000 to Sh100,000.

Moriasi was speaking during a youth empowerment programme in Kitale

He said youth who borrow Sh100,000 loans will also qualify for Sh25,000 each, so in total they will take home Sh250,000.

Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga has demanded that the IEBC refund him the Sh500,000 he paid as a fine for using the NASA colours and symbols and its Presidential candidate’s photo on his campaign material.

He said he wants to use the money to pay school fees for needy students.

The governor was fined on July 20 by the IEBC Disciplinary Committee and was required to pay it within 24 hours or be barred from the election. He was also ordered to pull down all the material within three days.

But on July 26, the High Court temporarily suspended the decision.


Earlier, Akaranga claimed he is a NASA supporter and Raila recognises him.

On Saturday, at a meeting with teachers at Hamisi, Akaranga said, “My supporters were wondering what changed even after Raila recognised me during the NASA manifesto [launch].”

“The court ruled that IEBC should give me back my Sh500,000,” he said.

Akaranga said the ruling has made him more popular, as even those who did not support him before now back him because they felt the IEBC decision was too harsh.In the last few days, the Kenya Defence Forces and the Kenya National Police Service have come under attack from politicians over allegations that the two crucial security institutions are being used to rig the August 8 election.

The opposition has maintained that it has evidence to back the rigging claims. On the other hand, the government has dismissed the allegations as baseless and only meant to cause unnecessary tension nationwide.

With the General Election barely a week from today, the country’s security institutions remain crucial. They must not been seen as leaning or working for any political group. The martial and other disciplined institutions actually have a core mandate of holding the nation together when the political class fails to do so.


That is why politicians, irrespective of their political affiliation, should respect the institutions created under the Constitution and not incite Kenyans against any particular institution.

On the other hand, those heading these institutions should at all times execute their mandates without pressure or orders from any other quarter. The military and the police should always be apolitical.
The government has identified 176 social media accounts involved in propagating hate speech.

NCIC and Communications Authority said 31 cases are under prosecution across the country ahead of the elections.

In a statement on Friday, CA Director general Francis Wangusi warned administrators of social media platforms that they will be held liable for any hate speech remarks.

Wangusi said any person contravening the NCIC act 2008 is liable for a fine of one million or imprisonment of three years.

While offences of ethnic contempt or racial discrimination will attract a fine of one million or imprisonment of five years or both.

"Bloggers, online news sites, political leaders and their followers should exercise discretion during the electioneering period," he said.

Whatsapp admins

Wangusi said it shall be the responsibility of the administrators of social media platform to moderate and control the content and discussions generated on their platform.

"Administrators of social media platforms will be held liable for any hate speech posts allowed in their forums," he said.

He said the use of social media platforms for political advertisement shall also be done in adherence to the electoral laws of Kenya.

"...the authors of political messages should be disclosed and all comments should be polite, truthful and respectful,"he said.

NCIC chairman Francis Kaparo last week put WhatsApp administrators on notice saying they will be held to account for fuelling violence ahead of the August 8 elections.

He said the commission is monitoring groups to deal with "terrible people on social media who aim to cause unnecessary tension in the country".

Wangusi further said website administrators should authenticate and validate the source and truthfulness of content.

This was after it was reported that fake news stories on upcoming elections are widespread on WhatsApp and Facebook.

A study by Portland and GeoPoll mobile surveying platform indicated that 9 out of 10 Kenyans have seen fake news ahead of the August 8 elections.

According to the poll, 90 per cent of respondents reported having seen false or inaccurate news in relation to the general election.

"Prior to publishing, to limit information that might spread rumours,mislead or incite people to violence,content authors should correct content that is established as false or misleading," Wangusi said.

Broadcasters social media sites

Wangusi urged broadcasters to manage their social media sites in a proactive manner to avoid posting of divisive and undesirable user generated content.

"Broadcasters are advised to exercise caution during this sensitive period to avoid giving hate mongers a platform to propagate hate speech, ethnic contempt and incitement to violence," he said.

Kenyans are preparing to elect a President, MPs, Governors, Senators, Woman reps, and Ward representatives on August 8.

Incumbent President Uhuru Kenyatta is seeking a second five-year term and Opposition leader Raila Odinga is determined to unseat him.

Campaigns have gained momentum with Jubilee and NASA leaders attempting to convince the electorate that they are the best.

A vehicle belonging to the missing IEBC's ICT deputy director Chris Musando has been traced at TRM parking lot in Nairobi.

The Land Rover Discovery was found intact at Thika road Mall at 1 am on Monday.

Nairobi DCI Chief Ireri Kamwende said the vehicle was intact and the search for the senior officer has been intensified.

The commission's chairman Wafula Chebukati said Musando was last seen on Friday night.

"The last communication from him is an SMS sent to one of his colleagues at around 3 am on Saturday morning," Chebukati said.

He added the content of the SMS suggested Musando was conscious and fully aware of his itinerary for the day.

"The matter has been reported to police and the commission, together with family members, is working closely with them to establish his whereabouts."


Musando was filling in for IEBC director of ICT James Muhati who was sent on a 30-day compulsory leave for not cooperating with the audit department.

Muhati was dismissed after a report by the Audit, Risk and Compliance department.

"He failed to cooperate in the provision of information requested from the department contrary to the public, finance and management regulations 2015," communications manager Andrew Limo said in a statement.

Lawyer Philip Nyachoti told three Appeal Court judges — Milton Makhandia, Kathurima M’Inoti and Stephen Gatembu — that Benjoh Amalgamated Ltd demands to be paid.

KCB has appealed against the decision of Justice Joyce Khaminwa (now deceased) that the bank forged a statement of account in respect of Benjoh to demand a payment of more than Sh70million. The judge said it was not known how the bank arrived at the sum.

Khaminwa said KCB did not maintain proper records for Benjoh and the statement before her was a forgery. KCB advanced a loan to Benjoh in 1989 to finance a flower project in Nyandarua.

The growth of South Korea's population this year will be the slowest rate ever recorded, despite efforts to boost it, officials say.

About 360,000 babies will be born, leading to concern over the effect of an ageing population on the economy.

Officials blame rising youth unemployment.

But couples say the rising cost of living, including housing and soaring education prices, means that having a large family is not an option.

Women have additional concerns over weak maternity-leave policies and a stubborn resistance by men to help with the housework, BBC World Service Asia-Pacific editor Celia Hatton says.


It is the first time the number of births in a year has fallen below 400,000.

South Korea has spent about $70bn (£53bn) trying to boost the country's birth rate over the past decade, handing out baby bonuses, improving paternity leave and paying for infertility treatment.

Officials fear that a low birth rate could reduce the number of people in the workforce and drive up welfare costs for the increasing elderly population, undermining the potential for economic growth.

South Korea's death rate in 2016 was estimated to be 5.8 people per 1,000 of the population, or about 295,000.

The Kilifi Professionals’ Association has backed Governor Amason Kingi’s reelection bid.

The more than 300 professionals on Saturday met the governor at his residence and offered “our full support”.

Chairman Karisa Yaa praised the Kingi administration for laying the foundation for the county’s growth.

“We’ve been watching from a distance. We feel it’s high time we added our voice and expertise to the journey of developing the county. We feel certain issues are not going on well, but the progress is encouraging,” he said.

Kingi welcomed their endorsement and urged them to leave their comfort zones and join in developing Kilifi.

“Don’t expect to see skyscrapers in Kilifi if you don’t want to return home and build your county. You need to be part of the journey,” he said.


Pwani University don Gabriel Katana and University of Nairobi’s Josephat Mwatela and Titus Kadere, formerly of the Coconut Development Authority, were present.

Katana urged the professionals to come up with ways of uplifting the education standards of the county.

He was also in the race on the Wiper ticket, but was barred by the IEBC over double party membership.

“I saw the potential in Kingi’s leadership. That’s why I decided to support him,” Katana said.

“As professionals, we should build a centre for education excellence so we can advise students on which route to take. We can make Kilifi a county where people come to benchmark.”Joe Nyagah has said he has no problem with President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition chief Raila Odinga as he helped establish the Pentagon.

Nyagah said his only problem is with Deputy President William Ruto whom he noted is " riddled with corruption and must be sent home".

"Kenya needs fresh blood...Kenyans want seasoned politicians with experience to lead them," he said in Kisumu on Monday when he asked for support for his presidential bid.

"Mkipigia Baba (Raila) one...two mpaka 10 mnapitia Nyagah kidogo (For every 10 votes for Raila spare some for me)."

Ruto has denied the corruption claims raised against him.

More on this: Corrupt? Not me, says DP Ruto


Nyagah urged peace so Kenya does not slide back to the 2007/8 post-election violence that left at 1,300 dead and more than 600,000 internally displaced.

He said the electoral agency must ensure the general election is free and fair and warned against malpractices, noting "those planning to rig want Kenyans to go back to the dark times".

On missing IEBC ICT deputy director Chris Msando, he said authorities must find him.

Mombasa governor hopeful Hassan Omar has said his rivals are running scared and are now desperately pulling all stops to try and stop his bid.

Omar, who is Wiper secretary general, said his opponents did not take him seriously when he first announced his bid but are now panicking.

He believes the court case against him was politically motivated.

Voter Hamilton Mwakitele moved to court seeking orders barring Omar from contesting on grounds he did not resign as a state officer.

Justice Eric Ogola declined to give the orders saying they will interfere with the election process.

Ogola said on Monday that the matter was not urgent and should be heard later as he does not want to interfere with the election.

“I wonder why the matter has been brought to court a few days to elections. It is not of urgency and will therefore be heard after elections," he said.

“The matter requires urgent determination but the determination should not be hurried."

The judge asked the Senator and the IEBC, which was a respondent in Mwakitele’s case, to file responses within seven days.

"I WILL BECOME GOVERNOR"

Speaking after the session at Mombasa law courts on Monday morning, Omar said the order showed he and his team will win in the first round.

“I am telling our colleagues...we are in the ballot. We have won today and we will win on August 8,” said Omar.

“I do not believe for a moment that this matter is accidental. It is because those we are vying against had initially chosen to ignore us."

The legislator later moved to Kongowea market where he told traders he will ensure the tax burden imposed on them will be lightened if elected.

The market has more than 10,000 traders and is a major hunting ground for all the five governor hopefuls.

But Governor Hassan Joho and Nyali MP Hezron Awiti believe they have done enough to secure their support there. Awiti has visited the county most, followed by Joho.


On Monday, Omar said attempts to bar him from talking to the people he represented in the Senate will not succeed.

He was responding to reports of orders issued to bar him from accessing the market. But the access was not blocked.

“Our adversaries right now have been caught off guard. They are now going to hold rallies with [Tanzanian musician] Ali Kiba at Pirates,” said Omar.

He said Mombasa residents are much smarter now and that they see through all schemes aimed at injustices.

STATE OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE RESIGNED

Mwakitele wants state officers' candidature nullified for their failure to resign before presenting their papers to IEBC.

He noted Omar and other serving MPs and Senators should have resigned five months to elections.

The voter also sued the electoral agency for failing to adhere to election laws and clearing Omar and the others.

Through lawyer Jessy Oduor, Mwakitele further wanted the court to issue orders directing that IEBC remove the Senator from the candidates list.

He also wanted the court to issue orders nullifying Omar's candidature and declare him unqualified for the election.

Mwakitele had also pursued an order for all state and public officers to be declared ineligible for the county governor post.

Omar questioned why the petitioner picked him out of all the state officers vying for election.

He said he needed more time to read the application before responding.

Omar further told the court he will also need seven days to appoint an advocate to represent him.

IEBC lawyer Mwachai Lumatete said the petitioner has ulterior motives as there are procedures to follow before going to court for interpretations.

He said Mwakitele should have gone to the political parties or IEBC tribunals instead of dragging him to court.

The case will be mentioned on August 5.Eva Buyu views the body of her husband IEBC acting ICT director Chris Musando at City Mortuary on July 31, 2017. /JACK OWUOR

NASA condemns in the strongest possible terms the assassination of Chris Msando, the Deputy Director in charge of the IEBC’s Data Centre.

We express our profound sorrow to his wife, family and loved ones, as well as to all Kenyans who have been horrified by this heinous murder meant to subvert our democracy.

In his multiple capacities, Chris was responsible for the entire body of electoral data that is the basis of next month’s election, including the Kenya Integrated Election Management System (KIEMS). That includes voter identity verification, results transmission and the entire electronic tallying process.

Chris Msando’s brutal killing was an attempt to drive a dagger into the heart of the forthcoming election, and indeed a dagger into the heart of Kenyan democracy. But we are totally confident that this terrible crime will accomplish the opposite and strengthen all Kenyans’ will to demand a free, fair and credible election.

It is painful for us in the extreme to have to report that Chris was severely tortured. We do not at this moment wish to add to the anguish of his family by giving more details.

Also read: State must tell Kenyans who killed IEBC's Musando and why - Chebukati

Chris on television last week assured Kenyans that they need not worry about the KIEMS system as he was sure it would work.


That no effort was made to camouflage[SL1] this killing as an accident shows the determination of the killers to send a chilling message that they will stop at nothing to ensure the outcome they desire.

Despite our grave concern about the implications of this murder and other recent developments, NASA would like to re-emphasize and reiterate its commitment to participate in the general election on 8th August. As we have saying repeatedly on the campaign trail, our supporters must turn out in large numbers without fear, as there are too many of us and we cannot be intimidated.

On the 9th of August, there will be a NASA government and all Kenyans, whether belonging to NASA, Jubilee or any other party, will be assured of the fullest protection of their security from then onwards.

We urge the IEBC Commissioners to soldier on and redouble their determination to provide Kenyans with the most transparent election in our history.

We have only one demand: this election must meet the constitutional requirement of a free, transparent and credible election.Ongare Owuoda’s farm in Nyatike, southwestern Kenya, May 31, 2017. /REUTERS

In the fields visible from the bumpy dirt road leading to Ongare Owuoda's home, acres of maize plants with sagging leaves suggest farmers here will reap a poor harvest this season.

Owuoda, however, is not worried.

"I am relying on my green gram harvest this season," said the farmer in southwest Kenya. "I do not expect much (harvest) from my maize crop because it has all been damaged by the pest."

An infestation of crop-eating caterpillars known as fall armyworm have ravaged harvests in Kenya and neighbouring countries, exacerbating damage already caused by prolonged drought.

James Ndanda, a government agricultural officer, estimates that about 40 percent of farms in western Kenya have been affected by the pest.

"Farmers will get a poor maize harvest this season," he predicted. "That could lead to food insecurity as the region is a big producer of maize."

BETTER ODDS

To protect themselves from total crop failure, Owuoda and over 50 other farmers in Nyatike village grow pulses alongside their traditional crops like maize – a practice known as inter-cropping.

"I grow green gram with maize, so that if one crop fails I can get a harvest from the other," he explained.

His three acres of maize are infested with the fall armyworm, while his one acre of green gram - along known as mung bean - is so far intact.

Other farmers in the village have diversified their production, some by growing soy beans as well as mung bean, and many said they expect to reap at least one harvest despite the drought.

But about 20km (12 miles) from Owuoda's farm, George Onyango is not expecting a good harvest.

Almost all of his 10 acres of maize have been destroyed by armyworm. During a good harvest, he can get 200 bags of maize and sell it for 100,000 Kenyan shillings (about $1,000), he said. A bad harvest gives him less than half of this.


"I am not sure how I will feed my family and pay school fees for the rest of the year," he said.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, about 143,000 hectares (350,000 acres) of land have been affected by the pest in the Rift Valley, Western and Nyanza regions of Kenya.

Ndanda, who through the government trains farmers in western Kenya on better farming practices, said farmers need to diversify their production to avoid losses caused by repeated pest attacks on maize.

"We want to avoid dependence on maize as a staple crop," he said. "Crops like sorghum and cassava – which farmers rarely grow as they don't sell as well as maize – should be grown more because they are more resistant to pests."

Owuoda now makes up to 102,000 Kenyan shillings ($980) per season with his combined harvests of maize and green gram, compared to 30,000 shillings ($288) when he only grew maize, he said.

FASTER, HEALTHIER

Growing pulses such as green gram also brings other benefits, Owuoda said.

Green gram matures in about two months – about half the time needed for maize – which makes it less likely to be attacked by pests, he said.

"Pests target crops that take longer to mature so they can breed on the plant," he said. "Plus green gram requires less rainfall to grow."

The small beans also are rich in nutrients, Owuoda added. "Mature grams produce grain but, even before they mature, my wife picks their green leaves and uses them as vegetables for meals at home," he said.

According to Nesline Ogwe, who manages an irrigation project in western Kenya, pulses also absorb nitrogen in the soil and feed it to the plant, replacing the need for fertilisers.

Lawrence Kiguru, a resilience officer at World Vision Kenya, a charity, said that pest warning forecasts could help farmers dealing with pest attacks, although for the moment "there is a lack of research on pest prevalence in the country".

Ayub Shaka, an assistant director at Kenya's Meteorological Department, said that weather forecasts generally can help farmers anticipate pest attacks because most occur when it rains. But he said pest forecasts were the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture.

Albanas Kyuli, a pest control inspector at the Ministry of Agriculture, said that while his department issues warnings for various kinds of pest attacks, it has yet to do so for the fall armworm "as we don't enough about how it works."More than 150 jihadists who left Britain to fight with ISIS have been stripped of their citizenship as fears grow they may return from war-torn Syria to unleash new attacks (file pic).

Ministers have stripped more than 150 jihadists of their citizenship and banned them from Britain, as intelligence chiefs warned they may return from war-torn Syria and unleash a new wave of attacks.

MI5 has previously said around 850 extremists from Britain travelled to the Middle East as ISIS took control of Syria and parts of Iraq.

But with the terror group now being pushed out, jihadists with British passports are fleeing back to the UK.

Many of those returning were trained in the use of explosives and firearms as they took part in ISIS's bloody rampage.

Time is running out for the government to act before ISIS falls, as it can only strip citizenship of those who will not be left stateless.

In May, security sources said around 350 ISIS fighters had already come back to the UK from Syria and estimate another 300 could yet return.


Among the British citizens still thought to be living within ISIS territory are Omar Hussain, a former Morrisons supermarket security guard-turned jihadi recruiter from High Wycombe, Aqsa Mahmood, a Glaswegian who went to Syria to marry an ISIS fighter aged 20, and London-born Muslim convert Grace Dare, whose ISIS husband Abu Bakr has since been killed.

Former British punk rocker Sally Jones, 49, left her home with her son to join ISIS in Syria and is on the Pentagon's kill list.

According to The Sunday Times, more than 40 suspects had their right to a British passport removed this year, with about 30 targeted since March in the wake of the London and Manchester terror attacks.

All of those who have had a so-called 'deprivation order' imposed against them hold dual nationality and include 'jihadi brides' and fighters.

Between 2011 and 2015, 72 people were stripped of their passports, with another 35 in 2016 and 15 in the first three months of this year.

The government has also introduced temporary exclusion orders to deal with suspects who have already returned to the UK and cannot be stripped of their citizenship, as well as so-called 'home grown' terrorists.More than 150 jihadists who left Britain to fight with ISIS have been stripped of their citizenship as fears grow they may return from war-torn Syria to unleash new attacks (file pic).

Between 2011 and 2015, 72 people were stripped of their passports, with another 35 in 2016 and 15 in the first three months of this year.

The government has also introduced temporary exclusion orders to deal with suspects who have already returned to the UK and cannot be stripped of their citizenship, as well as so-called 'home grown' terrorists.

Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale's sons narrowly escaped death on Sunday after their vehicle was involved in an accident at Kaimosi.

The vehicle, which had veered off the road, hit a banana tree before it landed safely by the roadside.

"My wives and I thank God for saving our four children in this afternoon's accident at Kaimosi."



"Kudos my brave son Tigana for controlling the car," Khalwale said.

Recent NTSA data shows that 1,633 people have died due to road accidents as from January 2017 to July 27.

The deaths were categorised as follows; Pedestrians (615), drivers (181), passengers (399), pillion passengers (135), pedal cyclist (28) and motor cyclists (275).

The transport regulator said this was a lower figure compared to the 1,768 deaths recorded the same time last year.


In that year, 665 pedestrians died, drivers (211), passengers (414), pillion passengers (125), pedal cyclist (42) and motor cyclists (311).

President Uhuru Kenyatta has entered a truce with the Maasai in Narok to correct his great grandfather’s wrongs in the late 1890s.

Uhuru’s great grandfather Kung’u Magana married a Maasai captive without paying her bride price.

The talks with the Kajiado and Narok Maasai began early this year.

Uhuru appointed former Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery, former assistant ministers David Sankori and Ngengi Muigai, and Captain (Rtd) Kung’u Muigai to represent him in the negotiations.


In an exclusive interview with the Star in Kajiado, Captain Muigai explained that Kikuyu warriors in the late 1890s raided a manyatta in Narok and took away a herd of cows and a young girl.

The girl, called Musana, was taken to Gatundu in the homestead of Magana, the father of Kung’u Magana.

Kung’u later married Musana and changed her name to Wanjiru. The two gave birth to Muigai, who was the father of the country’s first President, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, and Kung’u Muigai.

Captain Muigai and Ngengi are President Uhuru’s first cousins. Captain Muigai said since Uhuru was named after his great grandfather, the onus is on him to pay the bride price.A multibillion-shilling geothermal power project in OlKaria, Nakuru county, is set to begin following the conclusion of a protracted court battle that has lasted for two years.

At the centre of the dispute was RentCo East Africa Limited, which tendered jointly with Lantech and Toshiba, and a Russian firm OJSC Power Machines that competed for the lucrative Sh52 billion tender for the supply of geothermal power generation units to be used in the Ol Karia V plant.

KenGen had awarded Rentco the tender but later terminated it after discovering irregularities in its audited books of accounts. There were also allegations of using forged documents to bag the deal. The matter triggered vicious court battles by both firms.

On Friday, the Court of Appeal set aside orders by High Court Judge George Odunga that had quashed the Public Procurement Administration Review Board decision in awarding the Sh52 billion tender for the supply of geothermal wellheads to Rentco and its consortium.


Appellate Judges Asike Makhandia, William Ouko and Agnes Murgor said Odunga erred in his ruling by saying PPARB had no authority to make the decision. They said Odunga could only have interfered with the board’s decision if it was found to be illegal, unreasonable, irrational or disproportionate.

“The purported termination of the tender by KenGen was null and void. There was no allegation that the Review Board had violated any law or rules of natural justice,” they said.

The judges said no flaws were found in the procurement process and procedure to warrant the cancellation of the entire process.

“It is as perplexing as it is confounding that KenGen, having all through vehemently defended the award of the tender to Rentco and stood together with them on one side, all of a sudden, for reasons only itself can explain, took an about-turn to trash its own decision,” the judges said. KenGen initiated the project in 2015.A police car in the President's motorcade was involved in an accident in Nyamira on Monday.

Four people were injured when the car hit a Nyamira Sacco matatu.

This forced President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto to stop.

A source privy to the matter said they waited for the injured to be attended to before proceededing to Kisii.

Kenya Airways cancelled an unspecified number of flights on Monday after pilots refused to take up some shifts, the airline said.

The reason for a "go-slow" action taken by the pilots was not immediately known but the union that represents them, KALPA, went on strike last year demanding the exit of the then board chairman and chief executive.

"We have cancelled and combined some flights to manage the situation and to ensure our affected guests are taken care of," Kenya Airways said in a statement.

The disruptions at the carrier, which says it carries 12,000 passengers a day, started over the weekend.

KALPA officials did not return Reuters calls seeking immediate comment.

Kenya earlier earlier announced operational disruptions due to flight crew constraints.

The national carrier issued a statement at the weekend saying they have been forced to cancel and delay several flights.

The airline urged travellers to keep checking the status of their flights through their contact center and social media.

Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is due to appear in a Spanish court later today, accused of evading millions in tax.

Prosecutors allege Ronaldo, reported to be the world's highest paid athlete, has evaded €14.7m ($17.3m; £13.1m) in tax since 2010.

The Real Madrid star has previously denied the allegation, saying his "conscience is clear".

Ronaldo, 32, is the latest in a string of footballers to be pursued by the Spanish tax authorities.

Argentina's Lionel Messi, who plays for Barcelona, was handed a 21-month prison sentence after being found guilty of the same charge last year.


Earlier this month, the court ruled he could pay €252,000 in place of jail time.

However, Messi was only accused of evading €4.1m in tax, €10.6m less than Ronaldo, who will give evidence in his case at a court in the Madrid suburb of Pozuelo de Alarcon on Monday.

According to prosecutors, Ronaldo allegedly took "advantage of a company structure created in 2010 to hide income generated in Spain from his image rights from tax authorities" which was a "voluntary and conscious breach of his fiscal obligations in Spain".

Ronaldo's management have also denied the allegations.

But if the case is sent to trial and he is found guilty, the Portuguese forward could face a fine of "at least €28m" and a prison sentence of three-and-a-half years, the Gestha union of experts at Spain's Inland Revenue says.

Detectives have collected the finger prints of the killed hawker who invaded DP William Ruto's home in Sugoi, Eldoret, on Saturday.

The samples will be taken to Nairobi for examination to establish his identity, Eldoret West Police boss Samuel Mutunga said on Monday.

Mutunga said police have confirmed the man had been selling his merchandise at Jua Kali market for several months.

"Investigations will establish his identity and the motive of the attack."

The intruder was reportedly a well-known hawker who went to the home to demand payment from a worker.

But he stabbed a GSU officer at the gate, snatched his gun and a key, which he used to access the armoury, after which he staged an 18 hour-fight with the Recce squad before he was killed.

He killed one officer during the ambush.


Security has been heightened at the home, with the deployment of more GSU officers, ahead of Ruto's visit to cast his vote on August 8.

His body and that of a police officer who was also killed were taken to Moi referral hospital mortuary on Sunday morning.

But earlier reports indicated four gunmen raided the home while William Ruto and his family members were away.

It was said the four were killed by the elite Recce Squad hours after they attacked and injured a GSU officer at the gate.

Kenyan acting pioneers of the popular TV shows Vitimbi and Vioja Mahakamani have lamented at the lack of government support for their craft, especially with funds.

Speaking to Word Is, Mary Khavere (Mama Kayai), Lucy Wangui (judge) and Gibson Kamau (prosecutor) explained what projects they are working on and why you will not be seeing them in the TV shows.

“It is unfortunate that Kenya has no policy that supports actors, which would have a designated budget that would help in the growth and development of the entertainment industry as government support,” Gibson said.

Commenting on why the older cast of Vioja Mahakamani left the show, Lucy, who played the no-nonsense judge, said that “when the cast of Vitimbi was told to leave due to their old age, we quit in solidarity as we are a family”.


That explains why the show now has younger faces, including Nice Githinji, Dr Ofweneke and Aliwah.

The departing cast credited their success as actors to hard work and passion, saying that’s what has made them household names and icons in the industry.

In Vioja Mahakamani, they explained that the TV show had already created a mark in the entertainment industry. They say the new casts cannot match up to what they had created, because people watched Vioja to see them.

Frustrated by the turn of events, they decided to venture out on their own. Their new show will see them seek out new talent, mentor them and act with them in their new show called Jungu Kuu, which premiered on K24 on Sunday.

David Rudisha can’t wait to get back to the stadium where he ran a world record time five years ago and is confident he can maintain his dominance of the 800 metres at the world championships in London next week.
The 28-year-old Kenyan still holds the two-lap world record with the one minute 40.91 seconds he ran for his first Olympic gold, when he lit up a packed East London stadium on a balmy August night in 2012.
“I am really excited to return to London,” Rudisha told Reuters at Team Kenya’s training camp in the capital over the weekend.
“London is a special place for me. Breaking the world record in 2012 and winning that title, remains one of the greatest moments in my career.
“I am really looking forward to returning to the same stadium, and especially this time to defend my title.”
While Rudisha successfully defended his Olympic crown with a devastating last-lap sprint in Rio last year, injury prevented him from going back-to-back in 2013 after he won his first world championship gold at Daegu in 2011.
Victory in a tactical race in Beijing won him back the world title in 2015, however, and he returns to London looking to secure his legacy by matching the great Wilson Kipketer as a three-times champion.
“Being world champions makes us the people to beat. We are feeling that pressure, yes, but we are ready to soak it and remain on top of the world,” he said.
“Winning a third world title is going to be amazing. It is always important for an athlete to win major championship titles and this is what I am actually looking forward to.
“It is also very important for my career because the world want to see how this champion can defend his title and how long he will stay at the top of their game.”
Rudisha’s times this year in his few outings have been modest compared to the likes of compatriot Emmanuel Korir and Botwana’s Nijel Amos.
The same was true before Rio, however, and while he is conscious of the competition he will face at the world championships, Rudisha backs himself as a big race performer.
“There are upcoming athletes, but we are also happy to see the elite athletes still progressing and challenging and giving stiff competition to the younger lot,” he said. “I can’t underrate anyone. When it comes to championships, we have seen athletes in their best form being beaten.”

Dozens of people were left suspended in mid-air after a cable car hit a support pillar and came to a stop over the River Rhine in Germany.

Fire crews and rescue teams in Cologne used a crane to reach the 75 trapped passengers, some of them said to have been as high as 40m (130 ft).

Pictures show children being lowered to the ground. No injuries were reported.


All of the 32 cars believed to have been in operation at the time came to a halt when the incident occurred.

The collision took place at around 15.30 (13:30 GMT).

The incident is said to have been the result of one of the gondolas clipping a part of the support structure, bringing the entire cable transport system to a standstill.

The Luhya should come out in large numbers to vote for NASA principal Raila Odinga on August 8 and then vote for me in 2022, co-principal Moses Wetang’ula has said.

The votes next week will be crucial in determining who among the four co-principals will take over from Raila, he said.

Taking over from Raila

The Ford Kenya leader said that under a NASA agreement, Raila will rule for one term and the other four co-principals will have their chance too.

The principals are Raila, Wetang’ula, Wiper’s Kalonzo Musyoka — Raila’s running mate — ANC’s Musalia Mudavadi and CCM’s Isaac Rutto.

Wetang’ula said that under a NASA administration, power will be split equally among the five principals. Each principal will get a 20 per cent control in running the government and in appointments, he said.

Wetang’ula spoke on Saturday in Matungu, Kakamega county, at the manifesto launch of Matungu MP aspirant Peter Nabulindo of Ford Kenya.

Wetang’ula spent all Saturday campaigning for Ford Kenya candidates in Kakamega county and said the party needs many elective seats so he can negotiate for the 2022 Presidential bid.Shahbal declines Omar CEC off er, prefers adviser

JP’s Mombasa governor candidate Suleiman Shahbal has declined his rival Hassan Omar’s offer to serve as county executive committee member if the senator wins.

The two seek to wrest the seat from incumbent Hassan Joho of ODM. Omar is a Wiper candidate.

Shahbal told Omar that he is instead willing to serve as his private economic and financial adviser “if you emerge victorious”.

“I appreciate that he has offered me a job. I respectfully decline because I don’t want a full-time job,” he said.

“What I’d want from you, my brother, in the remote and unlikely possibility that you win, is that you make me your private economic and financial adviser. I’ll do it with a clean heart. I’ll offer 100 per cent support and work with you.”

The two spoke on Wednesday at Pride Inn during the Mombasa governor debate organised by the Kenya Alliance of Residents Association.

Joho and Hezron Awiti snubbed the debate.


Shahbal said he is certain he’ll win. He expressed concern over Omar’s ability to lead the county and to pull off an economic miracle in Mombasa, questioning his experience, knowledge or connections.

“In my view, the biggest problem that Mombasa has right now is the massive economic and financial decline that the city has faced,” he said.

But Omar said leadership is “the collective competence of all people who put heads into one stream for a common goal”.

He said he has national and international connections and will transform the county by making it clean and supply clean water for all.

Omar said driving Mombasa forward cannot be done single-handedly and promised to work with other leaders. “I’m a team player,” he said.

He said the fact that he headed the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights as vice-chairman proved he is competent. The two promised to ensure a peaceful election.Undated family handout file photo of Chris Gard and Connie Yates with their son Charlie Gard. AGENCIES

Charlie Gard, who died on Friday after his parents’ heartbreaking battle to keep him alive, will be buried with his favourite cuddly toys.

His death, a week before his first birthday, ended months of turmoil in which Connie Yates and Chris Gard fought for treatment they hoped would save him.

Gard poignantly brought one of his son’s two toy monkeys to each court appearance during their battle.

This was so ‘we always had a little part of Charlie with us’, Yates said.

The desperately ill baby had already survived three plans for his life support to be removed.

But on Friday, his breathing tube was finally withdrawn at a hospice following his transfer from Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Alison Smith-Squire, spokesman for the family, said: ‘Chris and Connie spent the weekend quietly with close family.

They face the anguish of registering Charlie’s death.

‘After that they will begin the agonising task of arranging his funeral.

They haven’t finalised any funeral plans yet.


‘But they have already decided Charlie will be buried with his beloved toy monkeys.’

Miss Yates said: ‘We should be planning Charlie’s first birthday but instead we’re planning his funeral.’

She had earlier revealed there were two toy monkeys – ‘so he was never without his special toy’.

The first footage of the parents taken from inside a court has also been released.

The hearing from June 8, published by the Supreme Court, shows Gard clutching the toy monkey as he sits next to Miss Yates.

Their faces show the strain they are enduring as they watch lawyers arguing about their son.

In April, at an emotional hearing at the High Court to decide Charlie’s fate, Gard, 33, hurled his son’s cuddly toy on to a bench in exasperation.

The same month, clutching the monkey, he told Justice Francis that his son ‘deserves this chance’ to go to the US.

Gard said: ‘We truly believe these medicines work. If there was no improvement, we would let him go... please give him the chance.’ But six days later, a judge ruled their son must ‘die with dignity’ as soon as possible.Olympics 3,000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto. /REUTERS

Olympic 3,000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto yesterday said he is ready for his first world title in London next month despite suffering an ankle injury during the national trials last month.

Kipruto will be flying Kenya’s flag in the country’s traditional sport, alongside four-time world champion Ezekiel Kemboi, former world and Olympic champion Brimin Kipruto and Continental Cup winner Jairus Birech.

“I am happy that I have been training well ahead of London championships,” he said.

“The injury forced me to withdraw from the Diamond League in Rabat but I have since recovered,” he noted.

If he wins gold, It will be his first world title in three appearance at the IAAF World Championships.

“I hope this time round, I will perform better than the previous two championships. I am excited to qualify for my third World Championships after winning gold in Rio Olympics last year,” he said.

Kipruto, whose athletics career was honed at Kosirai High School in Nandi County, made his international debut at the 2012 World Junior Championships in Spain, winning gold in his speciality.


He then gained selection to the senior team for the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Rusia, taking a silver medal behind Kemboi.

The rivalry between the two was also loud at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing, where Kemboi re-affirmed his status as the all time best in the water and barriers event winning gold in the season, where Conseslus had dominated.

Conseslus settled for silver with Brimin Kipruto taking bronze and Birech finishing fourth.

The four have intensified their training as they hope to continue Kenya’s dominance.

For Kemboi, it will be all familiar ground, having won gold at the 2012 London Olympics at the same venue.

Kemboi is on a revenge mission and has announced his intentions to win his fifth title after he was disqualified during the Rio Olympics over field infringement.Kenya skating boys’ team of Teddy Adanje, Peter Ngunyi, Denise Njoroge, Simon Kun’u, Isaac Mburu and Kevin Mutiso in past action. /FILE

Kenya’s Sylvia Wafula is hopeful of making an impact at the World Roller Skating Championships set for next month in Nanjing, China.

The athlete, who trains under Nairobi Sky Club, won the Eldoret Championships, clocking 35.76.14 in the junior category, where she was the sole competitor.

The 16-year-old is among the 17 skaters, who were selected by Kenya Federation of Roller Skating in June, to represent the nation in the world showpiece.

“I am delighted that I came to compete in Eldoret. This gives me another chance to improve on my skills ahead of the world show in China,” she said.

In the men’s 21km senior category, Geoffrey Ssendegeyo ruled the roost, crossing the finish line in 25.00.06.

Indian authorities have seized a massive 1,500kg (3,300lb) haul of heroin from a ship off the coast of the western state of Gujarat.

The narcotics were found on a merchant vessel, and were worth almost $550m (£420m), a statement from the coastguard said.

Navy spokesman D K Sharma described it as "the largest single haul of narcotics to date".

The vessel has now been taken to the western city of Porbandar.


India is part of a transit route in the lucrative drug smuggling trade, due to its proximity to Afghanistan, which is the world's largest producer of opium - the main ingredient in heroin.

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime says large shipments of Afghan heroin are smuggled across the Indian Ocean to east and southern Africa.

India has a serious heroin problem in the northern state of Punjab.

A study suggests that more than 860,000 men between the ages of 15 and 35 there take some form of drugs, with heroin afflicting 53 per cent of addicts."The women were accused of being witches, beaten to death and their bodies burned, police said." /FILE

Five women accused of being witches and murdered by a mob last week were among some 80 people killed each month in Tanzania this year by vigilantes taking the law into their own hands, a report said Monday.

Thousands of elderly Tanzanian women have been strangled, knifed to death and burned alive over the last two decades after being denounced as witches.

The report published by the Dar es Salaam-based rights group Legal and Human Rights Centre showed 479 deaths related to mob justice reported in Tanzania from January to June this year, including women accused of witchcraft.

Helen Kijo-Bisimba, the centre's executive director, said human rights abuses had risen in the past year, which she blamed partly on restrictions on freedoms following President John Magufuli's order to ban political activities until 2020.

Belief in witchcraft in the East African country dates back centuries as a way of explaining common misfortunes like death, failed harvests and infertility.

According to the report, most of the lynching incidents happened in the main city and commercial hub, Dar es Salaam, and in Mbeya region in the southern highlands where superstitious beliefs are strongly held.


"While 117 deaths have been reported to have occurred in Dar (this year), Mbeya sits second with 33 people lynched followed by Mara with 28 deaths and Geita with 26 deaths," she said at the report's launch in Dar es Salaam.

The report comes a week after police in the western Tabora region launched a hunt for the suspected killers of five women in Undomo village. The women were accused of being witches, beaten to death and their bodies burned, police said.

Wilbroad Mtafungwa, Tabora regional police commander, said vigilante killings related to witchcraft were on the rise in the region.

"We have launched a manhunt and so far several suspects have been arrested, but the investigations are on-going," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.

Human rights groups have condemned the rising wave of "witch killings" and complained there have been few prosecutions - causing anxiety among elderly women living in rural villages.

"Such incidents must be strongly condemned. We still need to educate people who harbour outdated beliefs to think that women are always behind witchcraft," Bisimba told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at the launch.Kisumu county secretary Lusi Ojwang. /FAITH MATETE

Kodiaga maximum prison has been put on notice following incidents of suspected cholera.

Three people, including an inmate, reportedly died from cholera last week.

Several other inmates were also hospitalised with diarrhoea and vomiting, symptoms associated with the communicable disease.

Kisumu county Health officer Lusi Ojwang said the prison management should stop using raw water drawn from a nearby river since it is untreated.

'We want the facility to comply with our health requirements and ensure they use treated water from KIWASCO, which is outside the gate and the only thing needed is connection to the prison," he said on Monday.

He said he visited the facility and found they have been harvesting water from a nearby river, which they treat by themselves.

"It's time they changed from harvesting water from the river, which poses high chances of cholera outbreak," Ojwang said.

But he noted that the county Health department is on high alert and will be able to respond to any outbreak.

He noted that four cholera isolation centres have been set within the county. They are at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital; Port Florence Hospital' Rainbow in Otonglo' and Kodiaga Prison.

He said samples of water from the prison were found to be contaminated.The World Bank will disburse Sh23 billion to counties for projects that improve the health of mothers and children.

Embu county was yesterday named the first to comply with all the requirements, which means it could receive the first Sh50 million this year.

The World Bank has given Sh20 billion for the five-year initiative, while the Danish development agency Danida will give Sh3 billion.

Embu Governor Martin Wambora said his government has made maternal and child health a key pillar.

“Last year we were voted the best in Kenya in health management and we want to continue to give our people the best,” he said.

Apart from Embu, 30 other counties have met the basic project requirements but their work plans have not been approved yet.

“We are working with the counties to ensure all 47 meet the basic conditions in the project agreement for funding to start flowing in this first year of implementation,” said council of governors CEO Jacqueline Mogeni.

The counties will submit proposals that will be funded at Sh50 million per tranche. However, they are expected to collaborate with the ministry of health, or an independent agency.

The entire project, known as Transforming Health Systems for Universal Care Project, is being financed under World Bank's Global Financing Facility Framework.

“It aims at improving the quality of primary health care services with a focus on reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health services in the country,” said World Bank senior economist Dr Jane Chuma.


Health Principal Secretary Julius Korir said the CoG and the ministry have recruited seven project staff who report to work next month.

He noted all counties have signed the agreement but must prepare an annual work plan stating the activities to be supported by the grants.

“The project’s funding to counties will be disbursed as soon as the work plan is approved,” Korir said.

The counties must also open a special purpose account with central bank, designate three officers specially for the project, and have the budget approved by county assembly.

“The council of governors notes that the process of requesting for and receiving these proposals has already began and the closing date is August 31,” said head of CoG's Mogeni.

Chair of the county executives forum for health Dr Andrew Mulwa said the project aims to increase skilled deliveries to 87 per cent, antenatal visits to 69 per cent and full immunisation to 76 percent.

He said they also want to increase contraceptive use by currently married women in reproductive age to 73 percent, and increase the rate of pregnant women tested for HIV who received results and

post-test counseling to 75 percent by 2020 from the baselines of the Kenya Demographic and

A top Jubilee leader is said to have hurriedly instructed his communications team to acquire a state-of–the-art drone camera (pictured) after realising that a similar strategy by NASA had taken the world of campaign photography by storm. The Jubilee leader was reportedly taken aback by an award-winning photograph taken by one of the drone cameras imported by NASA at a mega rally in Nairobi recently. With the mouthwatering level of photography employed by drone cameras and the ultimate psychological effect such pictures have on supporters, the two rivals are going out full-throttle against each other to win the numbers.

A Central-based JP lobby group is battling extortion claims after details emerged that it has been coercing people to fund it. One of its lead lobbyists, a former lawmaker, is said to be collecting thousands of shillings from Kenyans of goodwill, but the money never reaches the group. The former MP, who had been struggling financially until the godsend initiative was launched, has undertaken a major facelift of his wardrobe courtesy of the ‘well-paying job’. Factional disputes have now emerged, with infighting threatening to split the lobby, at a time when its mobilisation network is expected to come in handy as the campaigns roll to the homestretch.

Politics is the art of the impossible, so they say. A Jubilee governor aspirant from Nyanza, who stormed the race as an underdog, has turned around his fortunes and apparently appears to be the frontrunner in the gubernatorial race. The shrewd politician received negative publicity upon launching his bid, but decided to retreat to the grassroots with vigorous nocturnal campaigns that have seen him leapfrog his rivals. An internal opinion poll commissioned by the incumbent on the popularity of the Jubilee candidate delivered damning details of how the governor might lose the seat at the August 8 polls. The survey is kept under wraps, considering the damage its release would cause.

Is the NASA boat facing financial turmoil, barely eight days to the epic presidential contest? Well, Corridors is informed that a vicious tussle over control of campaign funds could hurt the opposition’s campaign sprint. That a family member of a top principal has taken charge of the much-needed resources to oil the campaigns is a sticking point that is fuelling the firestorm swirling around the NASA brigade. The ‘royal family’ member is said to have paralysed many of the opposition activities. Those at the helm of the presidential campaign secretariat feel short-changed as they allegedly have no control over the funds. Things could get murkier in the coming days.Visa SSA Group country manager Andrew Torre with ICT CS Joe Mucheru

Chris Musando's body had several cuts when it was found at City Mortuary by family members on Monday.

Journalists who visited the facility said blood oozed from his ears and nose and that the cuts were on his hands and head. Other reports indicated there were signs his hands had been tied up.

Oscar Awiti, the IEBC acting ICT director's first cousin, confirmed the cuts in a phone interview with The Star.

But Awiti said: “What has shocked us most is the fact that the body was clean and did not have any traces of blood oozing from the wounds inflicted by a sharp object."

Musando went missing on Friday and his body was found in Kikuyu, Kiambu county, on Saturday.

A post mortem has not yet been carried out and the body was moved from City Mortuary to Lee Funeral under unclear circumstances.

Awiti said attendants at City Mortuary told them the body was taken there on Saturday at 11am.

“We have had no communication with police so far and we are just confused about how it all happened. I do not want to talk much for now as we are heading to his home,” he said.


Before ending the call, he added: “My cousin appears to have been killed on Friday night and his body taken to the mortuary in the morning. The big question is, why was the body so neat and without any traces of blood [when we saw it]?”

Family members scheduled a meeting for tonight.

Following Musando's murder, the IEBC chairman postponed mock election results transmission that was to take place at Bomas of Kenya and centres in all counties.

Wafula Chebukati demanded a proper explanation from the government and assurance that all IEBC workers are safe.

They have been preparing for the general election that will take place next Tuesday.

"...there is no doubt that Musando was tortured and then murdered...who killed him and why did they kill him? That question must be answered," he said.

Jubilee Party hopes to get 25 per cent of the Kuria community’s votes in the presidential race in Migori county, the backyard of NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga.

The ethnic group, a minority in the county, commands 22 per cent of Migori’s votes and is considered a battleground.

Jubilee is banking on projects it has initiated, which include tarmacking of Muhuru-Kehancha road. Others are establishing two Technical Training Institutes and Kenya Medical College.

The community has 86,211 votes (Kuria West’s 51,057 and Kuria East ‘s 35,154 ). Jubilee believes it has made inroads buoyed by the 2013 results which saw the party share the votes with the opposition, almost equally.

Migori county Jubilee chairman Chacha Mosambi yesterday told the Star President Uhuru Kenyatta’s visit to the region last Friday increased his chances of attaining more than 25 per cent of votes in the county.

“We plan to get majority votes in the Kuria region to attain our goal. Migori will deliver,” Mosambi said.


Uhuru and Raila have campaigned in the region in the same month, with NASA hunting for votes on June 30.

On Friday, Jubilee promised to create two subcounties – Ntimaru and Mabera – in Kuria East and Kuria West.

Jubilee leaders led by Kuria West MP Mathias Robi said they will ensure the community reelects Jubilee.

On June 22, more than 500 youths and ODM party officials from the Bwirege clan, which has supported Raila since 1997, defected to Jubilee. Ntimaru East MCA candidate Augustine Mwera was among the defectors.

During his vist, Raila said it is a miscalculation for UhuRuto to bank on the community’s votes.

“I know and I am closer to the problems affecting the Kuria as we shared the same province. NASA is more at home with the community than Jubilee,” Raila said.The Energy ministry and a company involved in a project to mine Sh3.4 trillion coal in Kitui Central have remained silent on its progress, leaving area leaders in the dark.

The coal is to be mined in blocks C and D on the Mui Basin.

Kitui chief officer in charge of Minerals Investment Musya Mwinzi and Kitui Central MP Joe Mutambu said the concessionaire Fenxi Mining Industry Limited went silent on the project.

Mwinzi said information from the state had been plugged.

“We have to get information on behalf of the community but no information on the project is forthcoming. We are at a loss what could be happening,” he said on the phone yesterday.

“The truth is that I cannot tell you anything about the progress of the coal project because I do not have any information.”


But Mutambu was more candid. He said that lack of information from either the contractor or the ministry simply means that the project has hit a brick wall and has been halted.

“I want to be frank that the project has collapsed or we can say it is now stagnant. A number of factors have militated against the 400 million tonnes coal project. It is an economic loss to the people of Mui, Kitui county, and Kenya at large,” Mutambu said.

He spoke to journalists at his Nuu rural home last Thursday.

“It is common knowledge that only months into my election in 2013, I pushed for the signing of the Benefit Sharing Agreement between the Ministry of Energy and Fenxi Mining Industry Limited that had been given the mining contract, but sadly the project could not proceed,” the MP regretted.

“The coal project appears to have hit a dead end. The project appears to have collapsed ... We are all in the dark.”

Mutambu said global trends may also have dealt a blow to the project because international treaties are against the use of coal energy as it is a pollutant. He said the clamour for clean energy by the international community dims hopes for the Mui project.Machakos Governor Alfred Mutua's support base has declined significantly but he is still ahead of Wiper candidate Wavinya Ndeti, a poll has found.

The TIFA research showed the incumbent's popularity has declined from 81 per cent last August to 75 per cent in March and 59 per cent in July.

Ndeti's support has increased from five per cent in August 2016 to eight per cent in March and 35 per cent in July.

The survey which was conducted before Bernard Kiala dropped his bid for governor gave him a seven per cent rating.

Kiala withdrew from the race and declared support for Ndeti on Sunday.

The Deputy Governor noted the move was for the sake of promoting a NASA win in the presidential race.

"After much consideration and consultation with leaders in the community and our supporters I have agreed to withdraw from the race," he told a press briefing.

More on this: Kiala quits Machakos race for Ndeti, says Kalonzo presidency more important

A poll in March found Mutua would be re-elected if elections were held then. He got a 75 per cent approval rating and was followed by Ndeti at eight per cent.

Also read: Show of might as Ndeti, Mutua cleared

But when Ndeti joined Wiper in April, party leader Kalonzo Musyoka said she is likely to be the county's first female chief.

The politician teamed up with outgoing East Africa Legislative Assembly member Peter Mathuki in the race for the highly contested seat.

She returned to the party she quit in 2013 after losing to Mutua, who was elected on a Wiper ticket but quit to form Maendeleo Chap Chap.

Read: Wavinya Ndeti joins Wiper, Kalonzo says Machakos likely to get woman governor

TIFA further found NASA leader Raila Odinga would get 61 per cent votes and President Uhuru Kenyatta 37 per cent. One per cent of the sampled population had not made their decisions.

The residents feel closest to NASA (57 per cent) followed byJubilee Party (22 per cent) and Maendeleo Chap Chap (nine per cent) while 11 per cent were undecided.

Fifty eight per cent Machakos residents have not yet decided who they will pick for Senator. Seventeen per cent would elect Boniface Kabaka and 12 per cent Mutua Katuku.

Twenty nine per cent do not know who they will choose for the woman MP seat, 31 per cent said they will choose Joyce Kasimi and 16 per cent Susan Musyoka.

The research was conducted between July 20 and 24 through face to face interviews with 568 adults. It had a margin of error of+/- per cent.Siaya Senator James Orengo. /FILE

Siaya woman rep candidate Florence Aluodo has told the top ODM brigade led by Senator James Orengo to hunt for votes without seeking NASA flagbearer Raila Odinga’s help.

Aluodo said Raila has a tight programme to consolidate votes across the country, and they should stop engaging him in local politics.

“If they are men enough why can’t they ask for their votes peacefully without hurling insults and telling lies about independent candidates who equally have a huge following?” Aluodo said.


She said Raila will get Nyanza votes whether they campaign for him or not.

Aluodo took a swipe at Orengo, MPs Opiyo Wandayi (Ugunja) and Oburu Oginga (nominated), accusing them of scuttling Raila’s vote.

She spoke on Friday in Bondo where independents Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo and Mwai Andiwo pitched tent.Bungoma governor candidate Alfred Khang'ati has asked the IEBC to act firmly against his rivals Kenneth Lusaka and Wycliffe Wangamati for inciting supporters to engage in a fist fight during a funeral.

Two people were injured as supporters exchanged blows at the funeral of a businessman in Chekwabi, Kimilili constituency at the weekend.

Several vehicles had their windows smashed in the event that was also attended by Water CS Eugene Wamalwa.

Khang'ati told off Lusaka and Wangamati for embarrassing the Luhya community that has high respect for the dead.

"We have seen how the two candidates have brought shame, embarrassment and a lot of violence in our county for the past three months," the ODM candidate said on Monday.

He said the two leaders do not seem to care despite each being fined Sh1 million by IEBC for a chaotic rally in Bungoma town that left one woman dead.

More on this: Woman shot dead as Lusaka, Wangamati supporters clash in Bungoma

"We have reports that the two have been following each other neck-and-neck in every meeting. When one attends the other storms it with their supporters, especially at church and funeral services," Khang'ati said.

He asked IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati to take appropriate action against the two.


"We don't want such a scenario that endangers the lives of voters just because two people want to be governors," he said.

Kimilili police arrested Wangamati following the weekend incident, but released him on a bond of Sh30,000.

But Khang'ati termed the bail too low, adding that it should have been a deterrent.

In June, supporters of Wangamati and Lusaka clashed in Bungoma town after the two were cleared for the August 8 polls by IEBC.

A woman was killed by a stray bullet as police shot to disperse the rowdy group.

The rival groups also vandalised property and vehicles before police came in and fired tear gas and live ammunition.

The woman, identified as Kadogo who sells groceries in the town, was shot in the chest by a plan clothes officer as she tried to scamper to safety.

Khanga'ti will face off Jubilee's Lusaka and Ford Kenya's Wangamati in the general election which is seven days away.

World 800 metres record holder David Rudisha has pulled out of the world athletics championships due to a quad muscle strain, the Kenyan said on Twitter on Monday.

Rudisha, reigning Olympic and world champion, is the first and only person to run under 1 minute 41 seconds for the 800m. He would have been one of the star names at the Aug. 4-13 global showpiece event in London.

"Its (sic) sad and disappointing to announce my no show in the forthcoming #london2017 WC due to a quad muscle strain," the 28-year-old said.

Rudisha won his first 800m world title in Daegu in 2011, a year before his world record-performance at the Olympics in the same London Stadium where the world championships are being held.

A knee injury in 2013 forced him to miss out on defending his title in Moscow but he recovered to reclaim his crown in Beijing two years ago.

Rudisha said last month that he was in even better form than 2016 when he successfully defended his Olympic title in Rio.


He did, however, hint in May that he had fitness problems when he said he experienced a "minor strain" which led to him finishing outside the top three in Shanghai's Diamond League meeting that month.

Rudisha was slated to be one of 49 Kenyan athletes heading to London this week. The first wave of the team is due to arrive in the British capital on Tuesday.

No announcement has been made on whether Rudisha's place in the squad will be filled by another athlete.

There are four other 800m runners in Kenya's team - Emmanuel Korir, Michael Saruni, Ferguson Rotich and 19-year-old Kipyegon Bett.

Mama Sarah Obama has asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to visit Kogelo and lay a foundation stone for Barack Obama University College in Siaya county.

Sarah said the university will be a landmark project in memory of her grandson and former first black US President Barack Obama.

"A 50-acre piece of land has been set aside for the ambitious project," she said at her Kogelo Nyang’oma rural home on Friday.

This was during a visit by the US-based professor Michael Muiga - the founder of Barack Obama University.

Sarah said the university will serve all Kenyans devoid of their political, social and tribal inclinations.

Obama's step-grandmother further decried the pathetic state at the Barack Obama secondary school.

"Both the primary and secondary school sections are in bad state. We need to support them as they will act as reservoirs for local brains being prepared to join the Barack Obama University."


Mwiga regretted that it has taken unnecessarily long for the university to be established due to frequent infighting and local politics.

The academician said once the institution is established, it will major on irrigation engineering courses in a bid to address food insecurity and relevant issues affecting residents.

"Lake Basin counties stand to benefit a great deal since we are currently facing out from the rain-fed agriculture to mechanised one," Muiga added.

He said renowned retired professors from some of the top US universities will be engaged to offer their services at a subsidised fee once the college is established.

NASA has replaced James Orengo with Musalia Mudavadi as its chief polls agent for the August 8 general election.

Orengo was initially named the coalition's chief agent, deputised by lawyer Norman Magaya.

But in a letter to the IEBC on Monday, presidential flag bearer Raila Odinga asks the agency to disregard prior communication on the matter.

Raila names co-principal Mudavadi chief agent, deputised by Olga Karani. Orengo is named the alternate chief agent.

"Treat the above as my duly designated national agents," the Opposition leader says.

Read: NASA picks Orengo as its chief polls agent, lawyer Magaya his alternate


Mudavadi will be tasked with the responsibility of monitoring the declaration of presidential results at the national tallying centre at the Bomas of Kenya, Nairobi.

At the 2013 polls, the announcement and declaration of presidential results were riddled with drama.

At one point, security officers threw out Cord chief agents before the presidential results were declared.

The officers then surrounded the IEBC commissioners, as the results were announced.

Having lawyers as NASA agents is seen as a strategy to boost vigilance.

Agents will be required to scrutinise presidential results declaration forms and make sure the tallies are the same as those announced at the constituencies before appending their signatures.Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki. /FILE

Youths and the elderly in NASA zones are shunning government programmes meant to benefit them due to propaganda by Opposition leaders, Youth and Gender CS Sicily Kariuki has said.

Politicians are telling them the projects are a scheme by the government to rig the August 8 polls.

She said youths and the elderly are declining to surrender their ID cards for recruitment into the NYS youth empowerment programme and registration for the monthly stipends.


“The opposition terms everything the government is doing a trap for rigging the election because they lack development agenda for Kenyans. How foolish can the government be to use youths to rig the election?”

She spoke at the Approved School in Kakamega on Friday.It may still be pitch black outside but 4.05am is the moment when millions of Britain's worriers wake up concerned about their health, according to a new report yesterday.

For the latest research shows that Brits are becoming a nation of night time worriers with more than three fifths of the population - that's over 32million adults - waking up in the middle of the night thinking about a health concern that has not been checked off of their to-do list.

Overdue dental check-ups, losing weight and tackling stress are top health tasks keeping Britain awake, according to new data from Bupa Health Clinics.

The research identified 4.05am as the most common time for a 'health wakeup call', and it's overdue dental check-ups (25%), losing weight (23%) and talking to someone about stress or a mental health issue (20%) that are disturbing the country's sleep the most.

Booking a GP appointment for a niggling symptom and getting a general health check-up complete the top five concerns, according to the research by Bupa Health Clinics, which surveyed over 4,000 people across the UK.

Worryingly, a fifth of Britons admit that general health tasks are the least likely area of 'life' to be checked off the to-do list, being frequently delayed instead.

People are more likely to complete tasks related to work, their finances or relationships instead; meaning that paying in a cheque, asking for a pay-rise and even arranging a date will be prioritised over booking a GP appointment or scheduling in a health check.

However, it's not hearing the potential outcome of medical appointments that's putting people off, as almost half of respondents agree that there is just always something 'more important' to deal with in their busy lives.

Dr Luke James, Medical Director at Bupa Health Clinics said: 'This research highlights that despite de-prioritising them, lingering health tasks can quickly go from being a simple reminder to book an appointment, to enough to keep you up at night - 59% percent of respondents struggle to nod off when they go to bed and are instead worrying about not giving their health the attention it needs.

'The issue is that persistent worrying can lead to further problems - blood pressure can go up and people can start suffering from things like heart palpitations. These are potentially more serious conditions, which can be much more difficult to bounce back from. It's time for the nation to act, tick those actions off the list, and worry less.'

However, health-related 'to-dos' popping into our minds is not confined to the early hours - other common worry-moments are during the nation's down time (19%), in the shower (7%) and on the daily commute (6%).

The research also revealed that people in Belfast are the most likely to be woken up by a nagging health related task, followed by people from Cardiff, then Bristolians, those from Edinburgh and lastly the residents of Glasgow.


From a more national perspective, health-related tasks pop into our heads an average of five times a week with the top ten concerns being:

1. A dental check up;

2. Losing weight;

3. Talking to someone about stress or a mental health concern;

4. Booking a GP appointment about a niggling symptom;

5. A general health assessment;

6. Treating aches and pains;

7. Getting a flu jab;

8. Getting a mole checked;

9. Giving up smoking;

10. Treating a skin related issue like psoriasis or eczema.A file photo of live stream boards for relaying results in the auditorium at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi. /JACK OWUOR

IEBC has postponed the testing of election results transmission following the killing of acting ICT director Chris Msando.

Msando, who was the department's deputy director, was found dead with one of his arms cut off, police said.

The body was found in Kikuyu and taken to the City Mortuary on Saturday.

More on this: IEBC ICT manager Chris Musando found dead

In an address to the media at the mortuary on Monday, Chebukati said a new date will be announced.

"We were to have the simulation today but we have to postpone it," he said. "All employees should be calm. Chris was one of the most educated people around."

The commission was to test the transmission from 3pm at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi and the 47 centres in counties.


The exercise will examine the efficiency of the KIEMS so adjustments can be made before the election in seven days.

The system will be used in the transmission of results to the national tallying center.

President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto will face NASA's Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka.

Chebukati has demanded a government explanation for the official's murder.

"The government must tell Kenyans who killed Msando and why," the chairman said. "...there is no doubt that Msando was tortured and then murdered...who killed him and why did they kill him? That question must be answered."

Chebukati further demanded the government provide security for all IEBC officials before the election next Tuesday.
